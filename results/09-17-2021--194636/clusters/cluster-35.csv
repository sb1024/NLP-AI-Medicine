"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,9846761,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2019,68862,-0.01928238231545226
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9733308,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2019,388750,0.0012370159266425985
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9664620,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,573396,-0.005993194926060121
"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,9835005,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61610,-0.025814074393728785
"Multiscale ab initio QM/MM and machine learning methods for accelerated free energy simulations Q-Chem is a state-of-the-art commercial computational quantum chemistry program that has aided about 60,000 users in their modeling of molecular processes in a wide range of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and materials science. In this proposal, we seek to significantly reduce the computational time (now around 500,000 CPU hours) required to obtain accurate free energy profiles of enzymatic reactions. Specifically, we propose to use a multiple time step (MTS) simulation method, where a low-level (and less accurate) quantum chemistry method is used to propagate the system (i.e. move all atoms) at each time step (usually 0.5 or 1 fs), and then a high-level (i.e. more accurate and expensive) quantum chemistry method is used to correct the force on the atoms at longer time intervals. In this way, the simulation can be performed at the high-level energy surface in a fraction of time, compared with simulations performed only using the high-level quantum chemical method. In the Phase I proposal, our goal is to allow the high-level force update only once every 40—50 fs by identifying appropriate lower-level theories (Aim 1) and incorporating machine-learning techniques (Aim 2). This will accelerate accurate free energy simulations by 20—25 fold, reducing the overall computer time to around 25,000 CPU hours. Thus, our new MTS simulation method will make it feasible to routinely perform computational studies on enzymatic reaction mechanism. The addition of these new tools will also further strengthen Q-Chem's position as a global leader in the molecular modeling software market, making our program the most efficient and reliable computational quantum chemistry package for simulating large, complex chemical/biological systems. In this project, we seek to significantly reduce the computational time (ca. 500,000 CPU hours) required to obtain accurate free energy profiles of enzymatic reactions to ca. 25,000 CPU Hours.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample.

"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9787546,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,312939,0.018918286335746715
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,-0.004703439663506497
"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators.

"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9788239,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,562232,-0.001011139111296604
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,9642618,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'absorption', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,375602,-0.001953362387213137
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9705993,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314000,-0.01292742124241649
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9750722,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,527585,0.038256166771929966
"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,9656130,R01GM108731,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Behavior', 'Buffaloes', 'Car Phone', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Social Network', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Urban Population', 'Validation', 'Workplace', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'econometrics', 'epidemiological model', 'flu', 'frontier', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'public health relevance', 'social group', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2019,477166,-0.006758453172466263
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9716392,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2019,61226,-0.005628031965893785
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9608754,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,356625,-0.0177679210325259

"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9739188,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,506426,0.006321742368667029
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study. NARRATIVE Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function and—with recent instrumental advances—it is now possible to image hundreds of cells per months, enabling collection of cellular data at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,-0.019129618744452678
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9638561,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,364865,0.012385320289964552
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,0.009208294839166652
"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Automation', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor V', 'Floor', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genotype', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heating', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperthermia', 'Institution', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Plant Resins', 'Prevention', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantum Dots', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Temperature Sense', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thermometry', 'Thermoreceptors', 'Thromboembolism', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'cell growth', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'gene function', 'graduate student', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'melting', 'new technology', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'success', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,-0.03830126303835089
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems.

"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,9744013,K25DK115904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Columnar Epithelium', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelium', 'Esophageal', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophagitis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Squamous Epithelium', 'Stem cells', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'computer framework', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'injury and repair', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'standard of care', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational scientist', 'translational study']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K25,2019,171720,0.007928336841468762
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites. Project Narrative: The Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Treatment (SCRIPT) systems biology center seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. We will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients to generate clinical phenomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data that describe the host response, pathogen characteristics and microbiome of the alveolar space during pneumonia. We will then integrate this comprehensive phenotypic data into an ecosystem-based model to generate predictive biomarkers of pneumonia outcome for subsequent validation in a second cohort and tested for causality in a humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model.",Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center,9626377,U19AI135964,"['Acinetobacter', 'Address', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Alveolus', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Viruses', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fungal DNA', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data management', 'data pipeline', 'deep sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'hazard', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neural network', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'pneumonia model', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'viral DNA', 'whole genome']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U19,2019,2400000,0.00272102601755074
"Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence Abstract Enzyme functionality is a critical component of all life systems. Whereas advances in experimental methodology have enabled a better understanding of factors that control enzyme function, critical components of the reaction space such as highly unstable intermediates and transition states are best accessed for evaluation through computational simulations. Similarly, computational methodology continues to provide a key resource for probing excited-state processes such as bioluminescence. Combined ab initio quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) simulations are, in principle, the preferred choice in the modeling of both processes. But ai-QM/MM modeling of enzymatic reactions is now severely limited by its computational cost, where a direct ai-QM/MM free energy simulation of an enzymatic reaction can take 500,000 or more CPU hours. Meanwhile, ai-QM/MM modeling of firefly bioluminescence is also hindered by the computational accuracy, where it has yet to produce quantitatively correct predictions for the bioluminescence spectral shift with site-directed mutagenesis. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate ai-QM/MM simulations of enzymatic reaction free energy and to improve the quality of ai-QM/MM-simulated bioluminescence spectra, so that ai-QM/MM simulations can be routinely performed by experimental groups. This will be achieved via a) using a lower-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian for sampling; b) an enhancement to the similarity between the two Hamiltonians by calibrating the low-level Hamiltonian using the reaction pathway force matching approach, in conjunction with several other methods. The expected outcomes of this collaborative effort include: a) advanced methodologies for accelerated reaction free energy simulations and accurate bioluminescence spectra predictions, which will be released through multiple software platforms; b) a fundamental understanding of reactions such as Kemp elimination and polymerase-eta catalyzed DNA replication; c) a deeper insight into the role of macromolecular environment in the modulation of enzyme catalytic activities or bioluminescence wavelengths, which can further enhance our capability of designing new enzymes and bioluminescence probes. Narrative This project aims to develop quantum-mechanics-based computational methods to more quickly model enzymatic reactions and more accurately model bioluminescence spectra. It will lead to reliable and efficient computational tools for use by the general scientific community. It will facilitate the probe of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the computer-aided design of new bioluminescence probes.",Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence,9864664,R01GM135392,"['Adopted', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioluminescence', 'Calibration', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Fireflies', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Ions', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multi-scale modeling', 'mutant', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,269849,0.004343030739365658
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.

"Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS Network models are used to investigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, but rather than assuming that the members of a population of interest are fully mixed, the network approach enables individual-level specification of contact patterns by considering the structure of connections among the members of the population. By representing individuals as nodes and contacts between pairs of individuals as edges, this network depiction enables identification of individuals who drive the epidemic, allows for accurate assessment of study power in cluster- randomized trials, and makes it possible to evaluate the impact of interventions on the individuals themselves, their partners, and the broader network. There are currently two major mathematical paradigms to the modeling of networks: the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one specifies a model that states the likelihood of observing a given network, whereas in the mechanistic approach one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules at the level of individual nodes, the actors in the network, that are used to evolve the network over time. Given that mechanistic models directly model individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – they are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Another attractive feature of mechanistic models is their scalability as they can be implemented for networks consisting of thousands or even millions of nodes, making it possible to simulate population-wide implementation of interventions. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has however impeded their use in real-world settings, a limitation that stems from the fact that there are typically no closed-form likelihood functions available for these models due the exponential increase in the number of ways, as a function of network size, of arriving at a given observed network. We propose to overcome this gap by advancing inferential and model selection methods for mechanistic network models, and by developing a framework for investigating their similarities with statistical network models. We base our approach on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a family of methods developed specifically for settings where likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Our specific aims are the following. Aim 1: To develop a statistically principled framework for estimating parameter values and their uncertainty for mechanistic network models. Aim 2: To develop a statistically principled method for model choice between two competing mechanistic network models and estimating the uncertainty surrounding this choice. Aim 3: To establish a framework for mapping mechanistic network models to statistical models. We also propose to implement these methods in open source software, using a combination of Python and C/C++, to facilitate their dissemination and adoption. We believe that the research proposed here can help harness mechanistic network models – and with that leverage some of the insights developed in the network science community over the past decade and more – to help eradicate this disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network models are used to gain a more precise understanding of human behavioral factors associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS in order to develop more effective interventions to halt the epidemic. There are two main mathematical paradigms for modeling networks, the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach, and given that the latter directly models individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – mechanistic models are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has so far impeded their use in real-world settings, and we therefore propose to develop parameter inference and model selection methods for mechanistic network models in order to endow the biomedical community with these powerful tools.",Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS,9817000,R01AI138901,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epidemic', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SET Domain', 'Science', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'effective intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'network models', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,334891,-0.0034432829540338274
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us.

"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks.

Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community. Circadian rhythms are fundamental for biology and medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies are revealing how the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with the day and night cycle in almost every species, tissue, and cell. In close collaboration with biologists, this project will develop the informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine.",Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology,9690782,R01GM123558,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'annotation  system', 'bioinformatics tool', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,328155,-0.0005867633764664497
"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),9707307,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2019,1872216,0.006232808508458374
"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9518889,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells.

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9653955,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,587448,-0.019929275838431047
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9627935,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,2648073,0.03181303354760746
"Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets Complex biological processes, including organ development, immune response and disease progression, are inherently dynamic. Learning their regulatory architecture requires understanding how components of a large system dynamically interact with each other and give rise to emergent behavior. Recent experimental advances have made ii possible to investigate these biological systems in a data-driven fashion al high temporal resolution, allowing identification of new genes and their regulatory interactions. Longitudinal omics data sets are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice as well. Information on these collections of interacting genes can be integrated to gain systems-level insights into the roles of biological pathways and processes, including progression of diseases. Consequently, developing interpretable methods for learning functional relationships among genes, proteins or metabolites from high-dimensional time series data has become a timely research problem. The nature of these time-course data sets presents exciting opportunities and interesting challenges from a statistical perspective. Typical time-course omics data sets are challenging because of their high-dimensionality and non-linear relationships among system components. To tackle these challenges, one needs sophisticated dimension-reduction techniques that are biologically meaningful, computationally efficient and allow uncertainty quantification. Methods that incorporate prior biological information (e.g., pathway membership, protein-protein interactions) into the data analysis are good candidates for analyzing such high-dimensional systems using small samples. Here, we will develop three core methods to address the above challenges - (Aim 1): an empirical Bayes framework for clustering high-dimensional omics time-course data using prior biological knowledge; (Aim 2): a quantile-based Granger causality framework for learning interactions among genes or metabolites from their lead-lag relationships; and (Aim 3): a decision tree ensemble framework for searching cascades of interactions among genes from their temporal expression profiles. Our interdisciplinary team of statisticians and scientists will analyze time-course omics data from three research projects: (i) innate immune response systems in Drosophila, (ii) developmental process in mouse models, and (ii) longitudinal metabolite profiling of TB patients. These insights will be used to build and validate our methodology, which will be implemented in a publicly available software. This proposal is innovative in its incorporation of prior biological knowledge in the framework of novel dimension reduction techniques for interrogating high-dimensional time-course omics data. This research is significant in that it will impact basic sciences by elucidating data-driven, testable hypotheses on the regulatory architecture of biological processes, and clinical practice by monitoring disease progression and prognosis. n/a",Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets,9903643,R01GM135926,"['Biological Process', 'Data Set', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Time']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,351443,-0.005104435762379107
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,9830975,F31NS113385,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Endoscopes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Stereotyping', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'calcium indicator', 'complement pathway', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'indexing', 'microendoscopy', 'miniaturize', 'optogenetics', 'study population', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,38342,-0.019412758531542198
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9690083,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Marines', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,530377,-0.027933694483474072
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing.

"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9743790,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,653159,0.014360344366283083
"Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to improve understanding of transmission of resistant bacteria by characterizing contact networks in a national sample of approximately 25 long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Each participating LTCF will be visited twice during the course of this study for primary data collection. Healthcare professional (HCP) – resident contact networks will be ascertained in several different ways. We define contact networks as interactions between individuals that have the potential to mediate transmission. Our primary technique for estimating who contacted whom will be through self-report by health care professionals in the participating LTCFs. This approach will be compared to use of information about staff assignments, unit sub-divisions, and staff-resident ratios to make inferences about contact patterns. In addition, we will use direct observation to collect information about room entry rates and behaviors, such as hand hygiene, that influence whether an interaction results in acquisition. Facility and resident assessments will also be performed through chart review and survey. Resident level data will include presence of devices, infection status, antibiotic use, wound care, and comorbidities. In one to two of the participating facilities, we will use two new technologies to capture more detailed data on contacts within LTCFs. First, we will use a badge-based-sensor network to construct networks on the basis of personal proximity. This approach will allow us to examine how healthcare professionals and residents move within units of LTCFs and to analyze sequences of close contacts. However, this technology may not be sufficient to determine if the healthcare professional touched the patient. Thus, in a smaller number of rooms, we will use a second technological strategy, computer vision and depth sensing. This approach makes it feasible to collect highly granular data on behaviors such as use of gowns, gloves, and masks. Our analytical models will focus on dependencies between contact network structure, facility characteristics, and individual resident and HCP attributes. We will determine whether the number of unique contacts per individual are statistically dissimilar for different types of residents and HCPs. Alternative ways to derive contact networks will be compared with respect to overlap and completeness. Temporal models will also be used to examine dynamic changes in networks over time. Our hypothesis is that the structure of contact networks will vary according to the clinical services offered by LTCFs and that these structural properties will have significant implications for transmission and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our study will examine patterns of contacts between healthcare professionals and residents in a national sample of long term care facilities. Contact networks have been a major focus of epidemiological studies of infection transmission, but much more work has been done in community populations than in healthcare settings. Our goal is to advance understanding how diseases can spread within long term care facilities and to enhance our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different infection control interventions.",Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities,9753063,U01CK000555,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2019,720485,-0.013279966646375593
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases.

biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties ABSTRACT Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have broad-based potential in regenerative medicine cell therapies and can be isolated from a variety of different tissues. Though MSCs from different tissues are phenotypically similar, a barrier to their clinical use is the high variability of their trophic and regenerative properties. This variability suggests that inherent differences exist in the molecular machinery guiding MSC properties between different MSC populations, yet, to date, these differences are ill-defined. To this end, we have preliminary evidence that MSC phenotypes correlate to their regenerative outcomes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how the molecular and cellular properties of distinct MSC populations determine their regenerative properties. Our hypothesis is that MSCs from different tissues have different regenerative properties which correlate to specific molecular profiles defined by gene expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, the project proposed has three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will determine how tissue-specificity dictates gene expression and dynamic transcription factor activity of distinct MSCs. SA2 will determine how differences in the cellular and molecular properties of MSCs correlate to MSC phenotype. Finally, in SA3, we will determine how the molecular profiles and cellular activities of MSCs dictate their regenerative properties. Findings of the proposed study will provide novel insights about how the distinct molecular profiles of MSCs dictate their biological and physiological properties. In a therapeutic context, this would enable the development of innovative screening technologies for MSC therapies to identify and enrich for the most appropriate MSC for the specific therapeutic application. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Stem cell therapies are emerging as a new treatment approach to regenerate lost tissues, treat ischemic disorders, and treat chronic inflammatory conditions. Many of these approaches use stem cells from adults which are present in various regions throughout the body. Our research team is working to better understand how and why these adult stem cells behave the way they do so that we can better determine how to use them in different therapies to treat debilitating health conditions.",Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties,9835275,R01DE028657,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Pulp', 'Development', 'Disease', 'ENG gene', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gingiva', 'Health', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscle', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Osteogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'alveolar bone', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'healthy volunteer', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular phenotype', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oral tissue', 'osteogenic', 'population based', 'regenerative', 'regenerative therapy', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell population', 'stem cell therapy', 'stemness', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,398630,-0.030973110555750322
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9650393,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2019,220842,-0.018120355102846025
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9573854,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2018,388750,0.0012370159266425985
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9520706,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,591130,-0.005993194926060121
"Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling Project Summary/Abstract  This project develops machine learning approaches that describe statistical systems in biology. By combining analytic results calculated from the exact probabilistic description of the system with machine learning inference, our new methods present exciting opportunities to model previously inaccessible complex dynamics. The resulting Boltzmann machine-like learning algorithms present a new class of modeling techniques based on the powerful in- ference of arti cial neural networks. Further development of this approach will bring the groundbreaking advances from the surge of recent interest in machine learning into the biological modeling eld. The mathematical methods we develop will be used to derive e cient algorithms for multiscale simulation, directly applicable to large scale biological modeling. In particular, the algorithms will be used to study the dynamics of stochastic biochemistry at synapses, with direct relevance to learning and memory formation in the brain. Current studies of these processes are limited by the long timescales involved and the highly spatially organized structures featured. In addition to leveraging the machine learning expertise we are developing, we also employ new electron microscopy datasets to produce 3D reconstructions of neural tissue with unprecedented accuracy. Consequentially, we will be able to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, as well as the biochemical basis of oscillatory behavior in networks of neurons that occurs during sleep. Furthermore, the interactions of these highly stochastic ion channels with electrical in neurons will be explored through groundbreaking hybrid simulation environments. The software that we will develop combines existing popular simulation tools into multiscale approaches, and will be distributed as a powerful tool to the broader biological modeling community. Its usage in further computational experiments can present a key advancement in the development of pharmaceuticals, allowing the direct study of the interactions of biochemistry and whole neuron electrophysiology without making limiting assumptions to sim- plify the simulations. This has promising implications for intervening in age-related learning de cits, as well as in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Finally, this proposal will bring together our existing multiscale modeling community, the National Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS), with the MSM consortium. The interactions of these organizations and their communities of expert researchers will foster new collaborative work on exciting multiscale problems in biology, including applications of the machine learning frameworks and software we are developing. 1 Project Narrative  A wide variety of biological systems can be described statistically, from molecular biochemistry up to the network level activity of neurons. This work develops machine learning approaches to approximate these systems, enabling new simulation methods that bridge di erent levels of description. The resulting computational studies aim to shed light on the basis of learning and computation in the brain, and will enable the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. 1",Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling,9791802,R56AG059602,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consequentialism', 'Coupling', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'computer studies', 'experimental study', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'men who have sex with men', 'microscopic imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nervous system disorder', 'particle', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R56,2018,619053,0.0002207403190826703
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9640012,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'multiple omics', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,327382,0.018918286335746715
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM Project Summary Efforts to integrate contact network data with molecular surveillance data provide enormous promise for HIV tracking and intervention. However, the lack of tools to facilitate integrated molecular-social surveillance remains a substantial barrier to progress. For example, most contact network data only contains information on the immediate sexual and drug use partners of a single individual. Yet, the same partners can appear across the contact networks of multiple individuals. Therefore, partners must be matched across contact networks - a process called entity resolution (ER) - in order to provide an accurate view of the overall contact network structure. The process of ER currently requires either substantial resources to manually match individuals or considerable technological expertise in programming to more efficiently match individuals using probabilistic models. Accordingly, this project will 1) develop a machine learning algorithm to match individuals across personal contact networks and validate it using a large existing dataset of young men who have sex with men, and 2) create a graphical user interface to implement the algorithm as an add-on package to an existing tool for network data capture and processing (Network Canvas). The results of this project will provide an open- source and freely available tool that can drastically reduce barriers to matching individuals across contact networks, thereby providing researchers and public health officials with unencumbered access to the underlying structure of drug use and sexual networks, and a potent tool for integrating contact network data with molecular surveillance. Project Narrative Developing an accurate picture of the drug use and sexual contact networks of men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high risk populations can revolutionize the way in which HIV spread is tracked and intervened upon by public health practitioners. However, these data are usually limited to personal networks, which only include immediate sex and drug use partners. The current project will employ state-of-the-art methods in machine learning to improve the accuracy of matching individuals across personal network data and will integrate this tool into a user-friendly graphical user interface and data management tool, thereby substantially reducing barriers to studying contact networks and providing a potent tool for HIV surveillance and interventions.",Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM,9563322,R21LM012578,"['AIDS prevention', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'computer science', 'data management', 'disease transmission', 'drug structure', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men who have sex with men', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'young men who have sex with men']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,98987,-0.04802983083395773
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,-0.001011139111296604
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9530668,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,584485,0.038256166771929966
"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,9443636,R01GM108731,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Behavior', 'Buffaloes', 'Car Phone', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Social Network', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Urban Population', 'Validation', 'Workplace', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'flu', 'frontier', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'public health relevance', 'social group', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2018,496444,-0.006758453172466263
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data.

In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions.

"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9540546,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2018,58282,-0.005628031965893785
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9474101,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'human microbiota', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'operational taxonomic units', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbial community', 'oral microbiome', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2018,350321,0.008322702455042559
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study. NARRATIVE Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function and—with recent instrumental advances—it is now possible to image hundreds of cells per months, enabling collection of cellular data at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed.

"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9570304,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,528639,0.006321742368667029
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,9517061,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Hydration status', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'fiber cell', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,306284,-0.01988407531602032
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9420621,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,374683,0.012385320289964552
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9486312,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,1527746,-0.019129618744452678
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9543037,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,310328,-0.019677171548281684
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9549091,UG3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2018,1000,-0.021309280373841975
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9415436,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,445349,-0.009121794330840701
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9455006,U19AI135972,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virus pathogenesis']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,2799687,0.03181303354760746
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary

have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9394010,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2018,1639153,-0.018354623655308492
"A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network Project Summary/Abstract Networks have been widely used to describe many biological processes. Understanding the structure of biological network, especially regulatory network, will provide a key to discovering the mechanisms underlying important biological processes and pathogenesis of diseases. One of the most challenging tasks in systems biology is how to correctly reconstruct the networks from the high-dimensional data generated by modern genomic technology. Most network inference methods assume the network structure is time-invariant. Some recent studies revealed the structures of some biological networks are non-stationary or time-varying. For example, the neural information flow networks of brains are changing during learning process. Importantly, cancer studies found the native T cells would be converted into senescent T cells due to the structure changes of genetic network during tumorigenesis. The stationary network inference methods can't be used to reconstruct the time-varying network. Non-stationary network inference methods are urgently needed to investigate the time-varying networks at different stages. Some researchers have attempted to develop some time-varying network inference methods. However, the inferred networks using existing methods are only correlation or causality graphs, not regulatory networks which require activation & inhibition information. This project aims to develop novel non-stationary network inference methods to reconstruct time-varying regulatory networks from time series data. Since the networks are highly complex, it is not realistic to manually verify large networks as being used by the traditional methods. We will develop a powerful Model Checker, which is a Turing Award winning technique for hardware system verification, to intelligently verify the inferred time-varying networks. Our long-term goal is to integrate the statistical inference and model checking techniques in a unified platform to automatically reconstruct and verify time-varying networks. This integrative systems biology approach will make the large-network inference and verification automatic, intelligent and efficient. Recent cancer studies show that, restoring senescent T cells represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In collaboration with cancer immunologist, we will apply computational-experimental approaches to investigate what structure changes of the genetic network and how they induce T-cell's functional changes and influence its fate decision making from naive T-cells to senescent T-cells. Answering these questions will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation during tumorigenesis. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This project aims to develop a novel systems biology approach to reconstruct the time-varying biological networks from high-dimensional data in collaboration with the cancer immunologist. The proposed research has relevance to public health, because it seeks to investigate what and how the structure changes of genetic network induce the T-cell's functional changes during tumorigenesis, which will ultimately improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation and cancer.",A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network,9655801,R15GM129696,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Immunologist', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Muscle Development', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computer studies', 'exhaust', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'senescence', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,454500,0.004061309446421979
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets. Further emphasis is placed on utilization of other –omics to develop microbiome based prediction models in pregnancy outcomes, improving early detection of women who are at risk of preterm delivery.",Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types,9577818,R01GM129512,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Menopause', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'population stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'user friendly software', 'vaginal microbiome']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,396000,0.0005604294418969322
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified

The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9506810,R44HL127843,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Europe', 'Formulation', 'Glutathione', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospital Costs', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'State Hospitals', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'model design', 'novel', 'open innovation', 'oxidative damage', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'programs', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'wasting']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,428727,0.00817237607511595
"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community.

"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community.

"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients. I propose to discover the differences in the molecular network between healthy cells and ciliopathy patient cells in an effort to better understand the molecular causes of clinical presentations possibly open new avenues for therapeutics.""""""",Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes,9565420,K99HD092613,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bardet-Biedl Syndrome', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Cilia', 'Cilium Microtubule', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Human', 'Ion Exchange', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sieve Chromatography', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Obesity', 'Organelles', 'Orofaciodigital Syndromes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rana', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sea Anemones', 'Sea Urchins', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure of ciliary processes', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'cell type', 'ciliopathy', 'clinically relevant', 'developmental disease', 'educational atmosphere', 'fly', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'infant death', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'orofacial cleft', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K99,2018,100205,-0.03509577248218932
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9518337,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,537909,-0.019929275838431047
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways.

"Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to improve understanding of transmission of resistant bacteria by characterizing contact networks in a national sample of approximately 25 long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Each participating LTCF will be visited twice during the course of this study for primary data collection. Healthcare professional (HCP) – resident contact networks will be ascertained in several different ways. We define contact networks as interactions between individuals that have the potential to mediate transmission. Our primary technique for estimating who contacted whom will be through self-report by health care professionals in the participating LTCFs. This approach will be compared to use of information about staff assignments, unit sub-divisions, and staff-resident ratios to make inferences about contact patterns. In addition, we will use direct observation to collect information about room entry rates and behaviors, such as hand hygiene, that influence whether an interaction results in acquisition. Facility and resident assessments will also be performed through chart review and survey. Resident level data will include presence of devices, infection status, antibiotic use, wound care, and comorbidities. In one to two of the participating facilities, we will use two new technologies to capture more detailed data on contacts within LTCFs. First, we will use a badge-based-sensor network to construct networks on the basis of personal proximity. This approach will allow us to examine how healthcare professionals and residents move within units of LTCFs and to analyze sequences of close contacts. However, this technology may not be sufficient to determine if the healthcare professional touched the patient. Thus, in a smaller number of rooms, we will use a second technological strategy, computer vision and depth sensing. This approach makes it feasible to collect highly granular data on behaviors such as use of gowns, gloves, and masks. Our analytical models will focus on dependencies between contact network structure, facility characteristics, and individual resident and HCP attributes. We will determine whether the number of unique contacts per individual are statistically dissimilar for different types of residents and HCPs. Alternative ways to derive contact networks will be compared with respect to overlap and completeness. Temporal models will also be used to examine dynamic changes in networks over time. Our hypothesis is that the structure of contact networks will vary according to the clinical services offered by LTCFs and that these structural properties will have significant implications for transmission and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our study will examine patterns of contacts between healthcare professionals and residents in a national sample of long term care facilities. Contact networks have been a major focus of epidemiological studies of infection transmission, but much more work has been done in community populations than in healthcare settings. Our goal is to advance understanding how diseases can spread within long term care facilities and to enhance our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different infection control interventions.",Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities,9663122,U01CK000555,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,779516,-0.013279966646375593

"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM Project Summary Efforts to integrate contact network data with molecular surveillance data provide enormous promise for HIV tracking and intervention. However, the lack of tools to facilitate integrated molecular-social surveillance remains a substantial barrier to progress. For example, most contact network data only contains information on the immediate sexual and drug use partners of a single individual. Yet, the same partners can appear across the contact networks of multiple individuals. Therefore, partners must be matched across contact networks - a process called entity resolution (ER) - in order to provide an accurate view of the overall contact network structure. The process of ER currently requires either substantial resources to manually match individuals or considerable technological expertise in programming to more efficiently match individuals using probabilistic models. Accordingly, this project will 1) develop a machine learning algorithm to match individuals across personal contact networks and validate it using a large existing dataset of young men who have sex with men, and 2) create a graphical user interface to implement the algorithm as an add-on package to an existing tool for network data capture and processing (Network Canvas). The results of this project will provide an open- source and freely available tool that can drastically reduce barriers to matching individuals across contact networks, thereby providing researchers and public health officials with unencumbered access to the underlying structure of drug use and sexual networks, and a potent tool for integrating contact network data with molecular surveillance. Project Narrative Developing an accurate picture of the drug use and sexual contact networks of men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high risk populations can revolutionize the way in which HIV spread is tracked and intervened upon by public health practitioners. However, these data are usually limited to personal networks, which only include immediate sex and drug use partners. The current project will employ state-of-the-art methods in machine learning to improve the accuracy of matching individuals across personal network data and will integrate this tool into a user-friendly graphical user interface and data management tool, thereby substantially reducing barriers to studying contact networks and providing a potent tool for HIV surveillance and interventions.",Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM,9348928,R21LM012578,"['AIDS prevention', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'computer science', 'data management', 'disease transmission', 'drug structure', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men who have sex with men', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'young men who have sex with men']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,118784,-0.04802983083395773
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9355693,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,406785,0.038256166771929966
"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,9228386,R01GM108731,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Behavior', 'Buffaloes', 'Car Phone', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Social Network', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Urban Population', 'Validation', 'Workplace', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'flu', 'frontier', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'public health relevance', 'social group', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,483684,-0.006758453172466263
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community. Project Narrative Viruses are abundant in many environments and are important to public health. New statistical and computational tools will be developed for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples and for the prediction of virus-host interactions. These tools will be used to analyze microbial data sets related to liver cirrhosis and travelers’ diarrhea as well as marine metagenomics data sets from various geographic locations and time series.",Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications,9312083,R01GM120624,"['Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Body Water', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Measures', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Network-based', 'Oceans', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Soil', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traveler&apos', 's diarrhea', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'particle', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,395858,0.029814109367993925
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9260548,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,356625,-0.0177679210325259
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9270498,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbiome', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,311153,0.008322702455042559
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9221662,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2017,377226,0.012385320289964552
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9355203,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'Symbiosis', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2017,87929,0.015763878630741336
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9401936,UG3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2017,1000,-0.021309280373841975
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9266422,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,445349,-0.009121794330840701
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design A fundamental challenge to translate insights between biomedical researchers, who study biological mechanisms, and clinicians, who diagnose patient symptoms, is that many links between biological processes and disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. A comprehensive Biomedical Translator must enable chains of inference across objects as diverse as genetic mutations, molecular effects, tissue-specific expression patterns, cellular processes, organ phenotypes, disease states, patient symptoms, and drug responses, a challenge beyond the scope of any one organization. Fortunately, many individual links in this chain have been made by experiments yielding statistical connections between individual data types. High-throughput perturbation screens link chemical and genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes such as gene-expression patterns, cell survival, or changes in phosphorylation. Genetic association studies link mutations to human disease or intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers. Electronic medical records (EMR) link diseases or human phenotypes to diagnostic or current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, and clinical trials link the impact of drugs and drug candidates on disease states. In principle, incorporating these links into chains of inference could translate results between the full set of data types within them. In practice, each link is maintained by experts with domain-specific experiments, semantic terminology, and methodological standards. While a key challenge faced by a global Biomedical Translator is to establish consistent standards across these existing data types, a more important goal is to develop a principled and robust framework to (a) model biological systems and experimental approaches to investigate them; (b) organize knowledge about biological mechanism and disease; and (c) incorporate diverse datasets that serve as windows into the underlying and unknown state of nature. We propose to implement a Biomedical Translator as a probabilistic graphical model, a paradigm from artificial intelligence (AI) research. Just as separate research communities form weakly coupled parts of the translation process, graphical models allow global inferences from weakly coupled “nodes”. These inferences require each node to publish only probability distributions, enabling interoperability without necessarily having global entity-resolution standards, and benefit from paradigms for quality control, fault tolerance, and relevance assessment common in AI research. We hypothesize that a limited number of APIs, implemented as probability computations by communities around the world, would yield a Biomedical Translator as an emergent property of weakly coupled knowledge sources. From basic properties of graphical models, such a Translator could probabilistically translate among any data types connected within it, allowing for relatively complex query concepts. For example: What cellular processes in which tissues are impacted in a patient-based EMR? What genetic mutations sensitize cells to small-molecule treatment effects? Which small molecules mimic genetic “experiments of nature” that protect against disease? To illustrate the value of these resources and our architectural paradigm, we propose a demonstration project to implement a Biomedical Translator supporting queries between small molecules, biological processes, genes, and disease. The demonstration project will provide a valuable first step to confront key data-integration and organizational challenges and will enable previously impossible queries, such as identifying small molecules that perturb the same biological processes implicated by human genetics in a disease context. In this capacity, such Translator could realistically identify existing drugs for known symptoms (i.e., repurposing), but could more broadly serve as an engine for hypothesis generation and biological discovery, suggesting pre-clinical small molecules to develop based on their observed biological activity, or providing heretofore novel links between cellular protein function and disease pathophysiology. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9540181,OT3TR002025,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Probability', 'Processed Genes', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Terminology', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translation Process', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical genetics', 'data integration', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'protein function', 'response', 'small molecule', 'treatment effect']",NCATS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",OT3,2017,651119,-0.004965902377315983
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases.

We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9508669,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2017,162828,-0.018354623655308492
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,9325416,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2017,413065,0.00550215477793492
"Understanding host-virus interactions at the single cell level ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbial world presents one of the largest challenges to modern medicine in the 21st century in the form of novel, untreatable pathogens. Bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, are a major driver of this challenge. In particular, bacteriophages mediate the exchange of novel genetic materials (a process known as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT) between bacteria, transforming otherwise benign bacteria into human pathogens and driving the rapid emergence of pathogens resistant to existing treatments. Accordingly, there is a critical need to elucidate when, where, and how phage-mediated HGT occurs.  One critical aspect of phage-mediated HGT is lysogenization, the process by which phage DNA is integrated into the host bacterium's genome. Which bacterial cells are capable of being lysogenized and how the process of lysogenization is coupled to the physiology of the host bacterial cell are key questions in phage biology that remain unanswered. Recent technological advances in computer vision and single-cell imaging along with our lab's existing expertise in bacterial physiology enable us to interrogate this model system with unprecedented precision and find concrete answers to these long standing questions. We therefore propose to study these questions using E. coli and phage lambda as our initial model system.  Our guiding hypothesis is that the physiology of the host bacterial cells plays a critical role in the occurrence of lysogeny. Interrogating this problem of bacteria-phage interactions requires a systems level view of bacterial physiology and detailed dynamic measurements of lysogeny development. The goal of this proposal is to develop a system capable of measuring the activities of viral transcription factors, host proteins, and infection outcomes simultaneously in single cells. The analysis and interpretation of these data will lead to the discovery of novel host-virus interactions underlying lysogenic development and ultimately identify molecular targets that can be exploited to suppress phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteriophages mediate horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the exchange of novel genetic materials between bacteria, transforming otherwise benign bacteria into human pathogens and driving the rapid emergence of pathogens resistant to existing treatments. Accordingly, there is a critical need to elucidate when, where, and how phage-mediated HGT occurs.

"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9347295,R44HL127843,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Preservation', 'Blood', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Europe', 'Formulation', 'Glutathione', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospital Costs', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'State Hospitals', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'model design', 'novel', 'open innovation', 'oxidative damage', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'wasting']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,1099022,0.00817237607511595
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of

"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9310382,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,323033,-0.005362345162238139
"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders.

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients. I propose to discover the differences in the molecular network between healthy cells and ciliopathy patient cells in an effort to better understand the molecular causes of clinical presentations possibly open new avenues for therapeutics.""""""",Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes,9371331,K99HD092613,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Model', 'Bardet-Biedl Syndrome', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Cilia', 'Cilium Microtubule', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Human', 'Ion Exchange', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sieve Chromatography', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Obesity', 'Organelles', 'Orofaciodigital Syndromes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rana', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sea Anemones', 'Sea Urchins', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure of ciliary processes', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'cell type', 'ciliopathy', 'clinically relevant', 'developmental disease', 'educational atmosphere', 'fly', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'infant death', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'orofacial cleft', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K99,2017,100205,-0.03509577248218932
"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community. Circadian rhythms are fundamental for biology and medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies are revealing how the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with the day and night cycle in almost every species, tissue, and cell. In close collaboration with biologists, this project will develop the informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine.",Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology,9325275,R01GM123558,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasticizers', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'annotation  system', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'direct application', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,324508,-0.0005867633764664497
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9241579,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'model building', 'network models', 'novel', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,409580,0.038256166771929966
"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,9031775,R01GM108731,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Behavior', 'Buffaloes', 'Car Phone', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Social Network', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Urban Population', 'Validation', 'Workplace', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'flu', 'frontier', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'social group', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,583077,-0.006758453172466263
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9158909,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbiome', 'research study', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,311803,0.008322702455042559
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,9099858,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stereocilium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'density', 'design', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,306754,-0.01988407531602032
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.        ",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9089492,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2016,90000,0.015763878630741336
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9057057,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,445349,-0.009121794330840701
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design A fundamental challenge to translate insights between biomedical researchers, who study biological mechanisms, and clinicians, who diagnose patient symptoms, is that many links between biological processes and disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. A comprehensive Biomedical Translator must enable chains of inference across objects as diverse as genetic mutations, molecular effects, tissue-specific expression patterns, cellular processes, organ phenotypes, disease states, patient symptoms, and drug responses, a challenge beyond the scope of any one organization. Fortunately, many individual links in this chain have been made by experiments yielding statistical connections between individual data types. High-throughput perturbation screens link chemical and genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes such as gene-expression patterns, cell survival, or changes in phosphorylation. Genetic association studies link mutations to human disease or intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers. Electronic medical records (EMR) link diseases or human phenotypes to diagnostic or current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, and clinical trials link the impact of drugs and drug candidates on disease states. In principle, incorporating these links into chains of inference could translate results between the full set of data types within them. In practice, each link is maintained by experts with domain-specific experiments, semantic terminology, and methodological standards. While a key challenge faced by a global Biomedical Translator is to establish consistent standards across these existing data types, a more important goal is to develop a principled and robust framework to (a) model biological systems and experimental approaches to investigate them; (b) organize knowledge about biological mechanism and disease; and (c) incorporate diverse datasets that serve as windows into the underlying and unknown state of nature. We propose to implement a Biomedical Translator as a probabilistic graphical model, a paradigm from artificial intelligence (AI) research. Just as separate research communities form weakly coupled parts of the translation process, graphical models allow global inferences from weakly coupled “nodes”. These inferences require each node to publish only probability distributions, enabling interoperability without necessarily having global entity-resolution standards, and benefit from paradigms for quality control, fault tolerance, and relevance assessment common in AI research. We hypothesize that a limited number of APIs, implemented as probability computations by communities around the world, would yield a Biomedical Translator as an emergent property of weakly coupled knowledge sources. From basic properties of graphical models, such a Translator could probabilistically translate among any data types connected within it, allowing for relatively complex query concepts. For example: What cellular processes in which tissues are impacted in a patient-based EMR? What genetic mutations sensitize cells to small-molecule treatment effects? Which small molecules mimic genetic “experiments of nature” that protect against disease? To illustrate the value of these resources and our architectural paradigm, we propose a demonstration project to implement a Biomedical Translator supporting queries between small molecules, biological processes, genes, and disease. The demonstration project will provide a valuable first step to confront key data-integration and organizational challenges and will enable previously impossible queries, such as identifying small molecules that perturb the same biological processes implicated by human genetics in a disease context. In this capacity, such Translator could realistically identify existing drugs for known symptoms (i.e., repurposing), but could more broadly serve as an engine for hypothesis generation and biological discovery, suggesting pre-clinical small molecules to develop based on their observed biological activity, or providing heretofore novel links between cellular protein function and disease pathophysiology. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9337924,OT3TR002025,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Probability', 'Processed Genes', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Terminology', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translation Process', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical genetics', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'drug candidate', 'genetic association', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein function', 'research study', 'response', 'small molecule', 'treatment effect']",NCATS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",OT3,2016,399608,-0.004965902377315983
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,9125723,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2016,413065,0.00550215477793492
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9097814,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Internships', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,323032,-0.005362345162238139
"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,9267858,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2016,227250,0.0052905265607769095
"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in the subject of marijuana and cannabinoid (CB) research, there are only a few CB ligands currently available as FDA-approved drugs, partly because of the absence of experimental structures of CB receptors and a lack of knowledge of the conformational dynamics of the receptors, as well as a limited knowledge of the ligand-binding (orthosteric or allosteric) sites within the CB receptors. Very few allosteric modulators have been identified for CB receptors. There is great potential for discovery of novel CB ligands targeting either orthosteric or allosteric CB1 or CB2 receptor sites. Activators or inhibitors of these receptors are being investigated as therapeutic agents for many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In this project, computational modeling of human CB1 and CB2 ligands, receptors, and receptor-ligand interactions will be carried out. We are interested in discovering orthosteric agonists selective for CB2 over CB1, peripherally- restricted antagonists, as well as allosteric CB modulators, all of which may be able to provide efficacy without causing negative psychotropic effects. Systematic, computationally-intensive research will yield novel active hit CB receptor modulators, which can later be developed into lead drug candidates. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To model, train and validate various ligand-based mathematical models to predict and classify CB ligands as agonists or antagonists. Literature- reported CB ligands and activity data as well as experimental data obtained for proprietary molecules being tested at the University of Mississippi, School of Pharmacy will be curated. Ligand-based models will be constructed, trained and validated. Aim 2. To construct, validate and simulate computational models of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in their active and inactive states. Receptor models will be developed, some that are tailored for agonists (active state) and some for antagonists or inverse agonists (basal or inactive states), utilizing structural information from multiple homologous GPCR templates. Aim 3. To apply integrated ligand-based and receptor-based virtual screening (VS) protocols to discover orthosteric and allosteric CB modulators. Validated models from Aims 1 and 2 will be used strategically in VS protocols to discover novel orthosteric and allosteric CB ligand chemotypes. We will screen repositories of small molecules including MarinLit, ZINC, and that of the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) and virtual libraries generated using computational tools to access extended chemical space. Top- ranked VS hits will be procured, purified if necessary, and characterized to confirm their structures. Aim 4. To conduct in vitro testing in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays. Potential hit compounds from Aim 3 will be tested in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays in the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy NIH COBRE-supported In Vitro Research Core.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through computational modeling of the requirements for modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, which are class-A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we intend to discover molecules which act through the CB receptors and that could later be developed into new drugs to treat many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.            ",Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,9099196,R15GM119061,"['Academia', 'Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CNR1 gene', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cannabidiol', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis sativa plant', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Data', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Government', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutagenesis', 'Natural Products', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Organism', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plants', 'Publishing', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virtual Library', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'nanomolar', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'painful neuropathy', 'pharmacophore', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'repository', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI,R15,2016,427379,-0.02153941822526748

"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.            ",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,8818541,R01GM108731,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Behavior', 'Buffaloes', 'Car Phone', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Social Network', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Urban Population', 'Validation', 'Workplace', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'flu', 'frontier', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'public health relevance', 'social group', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2015,621703,-0.006758453172466263
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development. Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.            ",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,8964685,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stereocilium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'density', 'design', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,307928,-0.01988407531602032
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.            ",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,8886554,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473642,-0.009121794330840701
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,8904596,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2015,413065,0.00550215477793492
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8920676,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,323033,-0.005362345162238139
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.            ",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,8992226,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.0052905265607769095
"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale. Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, and the software developed in this application will provide unique informatic tools for analyzing such data.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.        This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.          RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community. As such it represents a key and irreplaceable community resource for genomics, genetics, systems biology, and translational researchers.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.

"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation.             n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8697162,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,333533,-0.005362345162238139
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal will explore obesity treatment strategies using small molecule allosteric modulators as probes of Y receptors.            ",Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors,8694027,R01DK097376,"['Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Arrestins', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain Stem', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chemosensitization', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cone', 'Consultations', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Histamine Receptor', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Obesity', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'interest', 'member', 'neuropeptide Y', 'neuropeptide Y4 receptor', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'peptide hormone', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic development', 'tissue-factor-pathway inhibitor 2', 'treatment strategy', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,339519,-0.02153037482982725
"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, and the software developed in this application will provide unique informatic tools for analyzing such data.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.        This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.          RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials. This will be accomplished by a multi-disciplinary team who will use their expertise in nanomaterial science, biology, toxicology, imaging, statistics and computer science to integrate above goals into a predictive model that projects from what is happening in cells to what may happen in the lung.",Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology,8464703,U19ES019528,"['Biological Availability', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lytic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'chemical property', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'cytotoxicity', 'hazard', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo', 'mathematical model', 'metal oxide', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanobiology', 'nanomaterials', 'nanoparticle', 'physical property', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'statistics']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U19,2013,1054947,-0.022428664140587598
"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.                            ",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,8549818,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2013,1235799,0.00550215477793492
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation.             n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8644396,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,322109,-0.005362345162238139
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal will explore obesity treatment strategies using small molecule allosteric modulators as probes of Y receptors.            ",Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors,8578312,R01DK097376,"['Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Arrestins', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain Stem', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chemosensitization', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Histamine Receptor', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Obesity', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Retinal Cone', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'interest', 'member', 'neuropeptide Y', 'neuropeptide Y4 receptor', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'peptide hormone', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic development', 'tissue-factor-pathway inhibitor 2', 'treatment strategy', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,352032,-0.02153037482982725
"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised. Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks.

"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to increase the power of two structure-determination methods, cryo-EM and NMR.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.        This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases.

"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.           Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples. Providing such methods to rapidly classify organisms using our new approach on a laptop computer instead of several multi-processor servers will facilitate the rapid development of microbiome-based health screening in the near future.

We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials. This will be accomplished by a multi-disciplinary team who will use their expertise in nanomaterial science, biology, toxicology, imaging, statistics and computer science to integrate above goals into a predictive model that projects from what is happening in cells to what may happen in the lung.",Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology,8393965,U19ES019528,"['Biological Availability', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lytic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'chemical property', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'cytotoxicity', 'hazard', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo', 'mathematical model', 'metal oxide', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanobiology', 'nanomaterials', 'nanoparticle', 'physical property', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U19,2012,75559,-0.022428664140587598
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.              Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised. Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks. This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology.

"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.           This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.           This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.         ",New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data,8101478,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Floods', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Group Structure', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Phenotype', 'Public Domains', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder subtype', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,290523,-0.02039089601841878
"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.              We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1).

"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers.

"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples.

"Rational design of cytokine releasing angiogenic constructs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of organized vascular networks necessitates a tightly regulated interplay between variable cells, growth factors and soluble mediators. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop therapeutic angiogenic strategies based on the rational design of cytokine releasing constructs that promote vascular patterning and vessel stability. The objective of this proposal is to i) develop electrospun, three-dimensional constructs with patterned architecture, ii) demonstrate that the spatial and temporal delivery of two model angiogenic growth factors promotes the formation of an organized capillary network and iii) develop a computational model that can predict the biological effect of a growth factor releasing construct as a function of specified fabrication parameters. We hypothesize that guided therapeutic angiogenesis (i.e. patterned vascular networks) can be obtained by controlling the spatial and temporal presentation of soluble mediators at the site of ischemia. In AIM I, we will synthesize bFGF and G-CSF releasing electrospun constructs and determine their programmed delivery as a function of fabrication parameters. In AIM II, we will demonstrate the effect of spatial and temporal control of cytokine delivery in promoting directed angiogenesis in a three-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis model and we will develop a computational model/software that can predict the biological effect of different scaffold configurations. We will validate our model by assessing the angiogenic potential of our growth factor releasing constructs in a murine critical limb ischemic model.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to a) fabricate a growth factor releasing construct that regulates the spatio- temporal delivery of angiogenic cytokines and promotes the formation of organized capillary networks and b) develop a machine learning computational model that can predict the angiogenic potential of our construct as a function of fabrication parameters.           Project narrative We are proposing to a) fabricate a growth factor releasing construct that regulates the spatio- temporal delivery of angiogenic cytokines and promotes the formation of organized capillary networks and b) develop a machine learning computational model that can predict the angiogenic potential of our construct as a function of fabrication parameters.",Rational design of cytokine releasing angiogenic constructs,8112574,R21EB012136,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'CSF3 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2', 'Gelatin', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth Factor', 'In Vitro', 'Ischemia', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Needles', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Tissue Engineering', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'capillary', 'cell growth', 'cell motility', 'cytokine', 'design', 'electric field', 'high risk', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'minimally invasive', 'multitask', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'scaffold', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic angiogenesis', 'tissue regeneration']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R21,2011,176524,0.012344453167784578
"High Throughput Screen for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. The molecular basis of DM1 is the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the protein kinase gene, DMPK. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that alter the biology of CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal transcript. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of over a million compounds. An initial screen of 2,500 small molecules from this library resulted in the identification of a potent lead compound, MDI16, which reverses aberrant RNA splice patterns in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in the HSALR mouse model for DM1. In a concerted effort to identify other potent lead compounds we propose the following: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay in the MLPCN center. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary cell-based assays to identify highly potent molecules that reverse four key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Aim 3. Characterize the selectivity and toxicity of lead compounds and identify their mechanism of action at the cellular level using a set of cell-based assays developed in the lab. Aim 4. In conjunction with the MLPCN center, we will refine the chemical structure of lead compounds reiteratively to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure. Over the past few years exciting strides in our understanding of the mechanistic basis of this disorder have been made. Thus the field is poised to make a major breakthrough and develop a drug for this disorder. We have developed a sensitive high throughput screen (HTS) to identify compounds that cure or ameliorate pathologies associated with myotonic dystrophy. Currently we have discovered potent molecules, which rescue DM1 pathology in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in DM1 mouse models. As our screens have been proven to identify potent molecules that rescue DM1 pathology, in this application we propose to identify other lead compounds by screening the MLPCN chemical library with our HTS. Identification of multiple leads will greatly improve the probability of a small molecule therapy for DM1.           Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our goal is to construct and test predictive computational models for how intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues, with relevance to tissue regeneration and tumor invasiveness. We address the question of how multi-pathway signaling networks downstream of ErbB family receptor activation quantitatively integrate to yield observed migration behavior, using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration response across all cue conditions.          n/a",Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices,8136318,R01GM081336,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell physiology', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Decision Trees', 'EGF gene', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'ErbB Receptor Family Protein', 'Family', 'Fibroblasts', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Property', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'm-calpain', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'receptor', 'receptor-mediated signaling', 'response', 'tissue regeneration', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2011,271548,-0.02674358536035879
"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,8131721,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2011,238085,-0.01781612734141591
"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Classification methods applied to microarray data have largely been those developed by the machine learning community, since the large p (number of covariates) problem is inherent in high-throughput genomic experiments. The random forest (RF) methodology has been demonstrated to be competitive with other machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks and support vector machines). Apart from improved accuracy, a clear advantage of the RF method in comparison to most machine learning approaches is that variable importance measures are provided by the algorithm. Therefore, one can assess the relative importance each gene has on the predictive model. In a large number of applications, the class to be predicted may be inherently ordinal. Examples of ordinal responses include TNM stage (I,II,III, IV); drug toxicity (none, mild, moderate, severe); or response to treatment classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. These responses are ordinal; while there is an inherent ordering among the responses, there is no known underlying numerical relationship between them. While one can apply standard nominal response methods to ordinal response data, in so doing one loses the ordered information inherent in the data. Since ordinal classification methods have been largely neglected in the machine learning literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) extend the recursive partitioning and RF methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; (2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods against alternative methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; (3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Novel splitting criteria for classification tree growing and methods for estimating variable importance are proposed, which appropriately take the nature of the ordinal response into consideration. In addition, the Generalized Gini index and ordered twoing methods will be studied under the ensemble learning framework, which has not been previously conducted. This project is significant to the scientific community since the ordinal classification methods to be made available from this project will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.           n/a",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,8049892,R03LM009347,"['Algorithms', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Northern Blotting', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Relative (related person)', 'Simulate', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'computerized tools', 'forest', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'neglect', 'novel', 'partial response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2010,5742,-7.052413094788673e-05
"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7791405,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,K25,2010,113132,0.02336241383967176

This will be accomplished by a multi-disciplinary team who will use their expertise in nanomaterial science, biology, toxicology, imaging, statistics and computer science to integrate above goals into a predictive model that projects from what is happening in cells to what may happen in the lung.",Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology,8146748,U19ES019528,"['Biological Availability', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lytic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'chemical property', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'cytotoxicity', 'hazard', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo', 'mathematical model', 'metal oxide', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanobiology', 'nanomaterials', 'nanoparticle', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U19,2010,27441,-0.022428664140587598
"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers. The dendritic spine synapse system is central to neuroplasticity and therefore human learning and memory. It is critical to understand this neurobiological system well enough to protect it against neurodegenerative diseases and environmental insults.

"Rational design of cytokine releasing angiogenic constructs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of organized vascular networks necessitates a tightly regulated interplay between variable cells, growth factors and soluble mediators. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop therapeutic angiogenic strategies based on the rational design of cytokine releasing constructs that promote vascular patterning and vessel stability. The objective of this proposal is to i) develop electrospun, three-dimensional constructs with patterned architecture, ii) demonstrate that the spatial and temporal delivery of two model angiogenic growth factors promotes the formation of an organized capillary network and iii) develop a computational model that can predict the biological effect of a growth factor releasing construct as a function of specified fabrication parameters. We hypothesize that guided therapeutic angiogenesis (i.e. patterned vascular networks) can be obtained by controlling the spatial and temporal presentation of soluble mediators at the site of ischemia. In AIM I, we will synthesize bFGF and G-CSF releasing electrospun constructs and determine their programmed delivery as a function of fabrication parameters. In AIM II, we will demonstrate the effect of spatial and temporal control of cytokine delivery in promoting directed angiogenesis in a three-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis model and we will develop a computational model/software that can predict the biological effect of different scaffold configurations.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks. We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process. But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment scheme.",Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin,7865088,R01GM093156,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune response', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Problem Formulations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell behavior', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'driving force', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'grasp', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,460864,0.0011950225378087812
"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices.

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7896417,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2010,332561,-0.02315400022478836
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7799797,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,317080,-0.020623190505406515
"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem.

"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Classification methods applied to microarray data have largely been those developed by the machine learning community, since the large p (number of covariates) problem is inherent in high-throughput genomic experiments. The random forest (RF) methodology has been demonstrated to be competitive with other machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks and support vector machines). Apart from improved accuracy, a clear advantage of the RF method in comparison to most machine learning approaches is that variable importance measures are provided by the algorithm. Therefore, one can assess the relative importance each gene has on the predictive model. In a large number of applications, the class to be predicted may be inherently ordinal. Examples of ordinal responses include TNM stage (I,II,III, IV); drug toxicity (none, mild, moderate, severe); or response to treatment classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. These responses are ordinal; while there is an inherent ordering among the responses, there is no known underlying numerical relationship between them. While one can apply standard nominal response methods to ordinal response data, in so doing one loses the ordered information inherent in the data. Since ordinal classification methods have been largely neglected in the machine learning literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) extend the recursive partitioning and RF methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; (2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods against alternative methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; (3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Novel splitting criteria for classification tree growing and methods for estimating variable importance are proposed, which appropriately take the nature of the ordinal response into consideration. In addition, the Generalized Gini index and ordered twoing methods will be studied under the ensemble learning framework, which has not been previously conducted. This project is significant to the scientific community since the ordinal classification methods to be made available from this project will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.           n/a",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,7670456,R03LM009347,"['Algorithms', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Northern Blotting', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Relative (related person)', 'Simulate', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'computerized tools', 'forest', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'neglect', 'novel', 'partial response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,74750,-7.052413094788673e-05
"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted in response to NOT-OD-09-058 NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications. Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Our currently funded R03 grant, ""Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,"" consists of the following three specific aims (SA.1) extend the recursive partitioning and random forest classification methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment including implementing our ordinal impurity criteria in rpart and implementing the ordinal impurity criteria in randomForest; (SA.2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods in comparison to existing nominal and continuous response methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; and (SA.3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been described. Herein we propose to extend the L1 penalized method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing a model-based ordinal classification methodology applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies considered in the parent grant. The specific aims of this competitive revision application are to: Aim 1) Extend the L1 penalized methodology to enable predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; Aim 2) Using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets, evaluate L1 penalized ordinal response models by comparing error rates from our L1 fitting algorithm to those obtained when using a forward variable selection modeling strategy and our ordinal random forest approach; and Aim 3) Evaluate methods for assessing important covariates from L1 penalized ordinal response models.           This project will develop L1 penalized ordinal response models and implement them in the R programming environment. By conducting extensive comparisons of various ordinal response modeling methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets, we will be able to make a recommendation regarding ordinal response modeling to the scientific community. This research is significant since the ordinal response modeling methods developed during the project period will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,7805045,R03LM009347,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioconductor', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Drug toxicity', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'In complete remission', 'Informatics', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'liver biopsy', 'meetings', 'neglect', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'partial response', 'preference', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'social', 'software development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,75000,-0.005443739778762634
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7653790,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,397297,-0.016571705042157263
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7685518,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathway tools', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2009,175647,0.013254544086964852
"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,8004341,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,K25,2009,39676,0.02336241383967176

"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers. The dendritic spine synapse system is central to neuroplasticity and therefore human learning and memory. It is critical to understand this neurobiological system well enough to protect it against neurodegenerative diseases and environmental insults.

"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16).

"Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is aimed at developing better understanding of how people bring their prior knowledge to the table when learning about new concepts. Both experimental studies and computational models of these processes will be used to further understanding of this fundamental aspect of human cognition. The proposal focuses on effects and interactions that show that memorized exemplars of a problem are involved with concept learning, on processes involved in unsupervised sorting without feedback, and on how these two processes interact with pre-existing concepts and relational knowledge. New computational models will incorporate exemplars and unsupervised learning into an existing model of knowledge and supervised learning, accounting for a variety of previously observed and newly predicted effects. Experiments involving human participants will investigate interactions of prior knowledge with frequency, exposure, and concept structure. Experiments are paired with the modeling so that new empirical discoveries will go hand-in-hand with theoretical development. If successful, this model will be the only one in the field that accounts for this range of phenomena, encompassing both statistical learning and use of prior knowledge in concept acquisition. Relevance to Public Health: Categorization and category learning are fundamental aspects of cognition, allowing people to intelligently respond to the world. As categorization can be impaired by neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, and amnesia, a rigorous understanding of the processes involved in normal populations aides the research and treatment of disorders in patients. This project will provide a detailed computational model of concept learning, which can then serve as a model to investigate what has gone wrong when the process is disrupted in clinical populations.           n/a",Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning,7633119,F32MH076452,"['Accounting', 'Amnesia', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'theories']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2009,18437,0.006268766575491882
"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies,7658677,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28202,-0.042418677452888395
"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our goal is to construct and test predictive computational models for how intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments.

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7625039,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,536571,0.00799502053396675
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7646234,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2009,335920,-0.02315400022478836
"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7878908,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,88138,-0.020623190505406515

Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7587461,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,321780,-0.020623190505406515
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7669377,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2009,240426,-0.01781612734141591
"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Classification methods applied to microarray data have largely been those developed by the machine learning community, since the large p (number of covariates) problem is inherent in high-throughput genomic experiments. The random forest (RF) methodology has been demonstrated to be competitive with other machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks and support vector machines). Apart from improved accuracy, a clear advantage of the RF method in comparison to most machine learning approaches is that variable importance measures are provided by the algorithm. Therefore, one can assess the relative importance each gene has on the predictive model. In a large number of applications, the class to be predicted may be inherently ordinal. Examples of ordinal responses include TNM stage (I,II,III, IV); drug toxicity (none, mild, moderate, severe); or response to treatment classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. These responses are ordinal; while there is an inherent ordering among the responses, there is no known underlying numerical relationship between them. While one can apply standard nominal response methods to ordinal response data, in so doing one loses the ordered information inherent in the data. Since ordinal classification methods have been largely neglected in the machine learning literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) extend the recursive partitioning and RF methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; (2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods against alternative methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; (3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Novel splitting criteria for classification tree growing and methods for estimating variable importance are proposed, which appropriately take the nature of the ordinal response into consideration. In addition, the Generalized Gini index and ordered twoing methods will be studied under the ensemble learning framework, which has not been previously conducted. This project is significant to the scientific community since the ordinal classification methods to be made available from this project will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.           n/a",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,7470967,R03LM009347,"['Algorithms', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Northern Blotting', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Relative (related person)', 'Simulate', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'computerized tools', 'forest', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'neglect', 'novel', 'partial response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,74521,-7.052413094788673e-05
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7496031,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,383732,-0.016571705042157263
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7504002,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2008,176002,0.013254544086964852
"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7491749,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K25,2008,106794,0.02336241383967176
"A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the main challenges in the discovery of intracellular biomarkers and identification of therapeutic targets is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying pathways. The tremendous increase in both the quantity and diversity of cellular data represents a significant challenge to researchers seeking to construct biologically relevant interaction maps, and objectively extract specific actionable information. Machine learning based clustering algorithms serve as a preliminary statistical data analysis metric, but they fail to capture the data in the proper biological context. While chemical kinetics based models have proved to be effective in elucidating the pathway mechanisms, accurate estimates for the model parameters are severely lacking and are often impossible to obtain owing to the inherent difficulties involved in making dynamic measurements of specific intracellular phenomena. Additionally, methods for rational prioritization and selection of critical intracellular interactions (in the absence of kinetic information) are sorely lacking. Therefore, there is a clear need for innovative software tools that enable quantitative analysis of available microarray data in a biological pathway context, ultimately leading to the objective identification of critical biological interactions, providing a direction for more focused future efforts. We propose to address this challenge by developing an automated software platform that utilizes microarray data to select and merge relevant canonical biological pathway models thereby placing significantly expressed genes in their biological context. The analysis software will utilize a microarray expression-weighted metric to objectively rank the most critical interactions within the network model using a novel chemical kinetics-free Boolean dynamics algorithm. In the Phase I effort, we will develop a software tool composed of an R library that enables the automated generation of a pathway model from a given microarray dataset. Additionally, a methodology, and associated R library will be developed to objectively rank critical interactions in the pathway model, using a microarray data expression-weighted metric. Demonstration and validation of proposed algorithm will be carried out using a well characterized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage system. In Phase II, we will extend the scope of the algorithmic framework to include proteomic and metabolomic weighting in the objective ranking of critical interactions, and add workflow improvements through the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI). Experimental verification and validation of critical interactions identified in Phase I will be carried out using gene-silencing techniques. We also intend to establish collaborative partnerships with commercial entities. The proposing team has extensive experience in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics (CFDRC) and microarray data analysis (Shawn Levy, University of Vanderbilt). CFDRC has a strong track record in the commercialization of software and hardware. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in both the amount and diversity of cellular data available to researchers, representing a clear need for the development of advanced computational analysis software to enable the discovery of biomarkers of disease states, and identification of new therapeutic targets. However, currently available analysis tools do not consider the data in a proper biological context.

"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers.

"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16).

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths. This research will develop an innovative computational system with implications for early detection of cancer as well as potential recurrence and metastasis, leading to increased survival rates.

"Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is aimed at developing better understanding of how people bring their prior knowledge to the table when learning about new concepts. Both experimental studies and computational models of these processes will be used to further understanding of this fundamental aspect of human cognition. The proposal focuses on effects and interactions that show that memorized exemplars of a problem are involved with concept learning, on processes involved in unsupervised sorting without feedback, and on how these two processes interact with pre-existing concepts and relational knowledge. New computational models will incorporate exemplars and unsupervised learning into an existing model of knowledge and supervised learning, accounting for a variety of previously observed and newly predicted effects. Experiments involving human participants will investigate interactions of prior knowledge with frequency, exposure, and concept structure. Experiments are paired with the modeling so that new empirical discoveries will go hand-in-hand with theoretical development. If successful, this model will be the only one in the field that accounts for this range of phenomena, encompassing both statistical learning and use of prior knowledge in concept acquisition. Relevance to Public Health: Categorization and category learning are fundamental aspects of cognition, allowing people to intelligently respond to the world. As categorization can be impaired by neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, and amnesia, a rigorous understanding of the processes involved in normal populations aides the research and treatment of disorders in patients. This project will provide a detailed computational model of concept learning, which can then serve as a model to investigate what has gone wrong when the process is disrupted in clinical populations.           n/a",Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning,7489320,F32MH076452,"['Accounting', 'Amnesia', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'base', 'computer studies', 'concept', 'experience', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'theories']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2008,52898,0.006268766575491882
"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies,7546079,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'concept', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,32027,-0.042418677452888395
"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our goal is to construct and test predictive computational models for how intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments.

"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets).

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7440169,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Numbers', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,535031,0.00799502053396675
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7473118,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2008,335920,-0.02315400022478836

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7436259,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Condition', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Numbers', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Range', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Role playing therapy', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,393279,-0.020623190505406515
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7387471,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,220227,-0.007636586385275145
"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease. n/a",Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior,7555864,DP1OD003787,"['Acidity', 'Acids', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Base Pairing', 'Basic Science', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Carbon', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Cytochromes', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Drops', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Growth', 'Habitats', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Hybridization Array', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Detection', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Output', 'Oxidases', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Perception', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Psychological Manipulation', 'Psychology', 'Pulse taking', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Salts', 'Science', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'electron donor', 'enteric pathogen', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'microbial', 'microbial disease', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP1,2008,805000,-0.017767179695278985
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7483692,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Endopeptidases', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2008,242920,-0.01781612734141591
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7322388,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,364130,-0.016571705042157263
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7301424,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2007,173307,0.013254544086964852
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7286095,K22LM008794,"['Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Antibodies', 'Antigenic Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Buffers', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissociation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Haptens', 'Hemolysin', 'Immunology', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'antibody engineering', 'antigen antibody binding', 'antigen binding', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experimental analysis', 'markov model', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanopore', 'programs', 'protein structure function', 'prototype', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'tool', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2007,162000,-0.036209740895462646
"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7208003,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K25,2007,103762,0.02336241383967176
"Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is aimed at developing better understanding of how people bring their prior knowledge to the table when learning about new concepts. Both experimental studies and computational models of these processes will be used to further understanding of this fundamental aspect of human cognition. The proposal focuses on effects and interactions that show that memorized exemplars of a problem are involved with concept learning, on processes involved in unsupervised sorting without feedback, and on how these two processes interact with pre-existing concepts and relational knowledge. New computational models will incorporate exemplars and unsupervised learning into an existing model of knowledge and supervised learning, accounting for a variety of previously observed and newly predicted effects. Experiments involving human participants will investigate interactions of prior knowledge with frequency, exposure, and concept structure. Experiments are paired with the modeling so that new empirical discoveries will go hand-in-hand with theoretical development. If successful, this model will be the only one in the field that accounts for this range of phenomena, encompassing both statistical learning and use of prior knowledge in concept acquisition. Relevance to Public Health: Categorization and category learning are fundamental aspects of cognition, allowing people to intelligently respond to the world. As categorization can be impaired by neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, and amnesia, a rigorous understanding of the processes involved in normal populations aides the research and treatment of disorders in patients.

"Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuing project is directed at describing dendrite structure in a compact yet sufficiently complete and detailed fashion to allow the computer generation of morphologically accurate neuronal models. Dendrite morphology plays a fundamental role in physiological and pathological brain function by subserving and shaping network connectivity and by integrating the complex pattern of synaptic inputs received by the neuron. A parsimonious and algorithmic description of dendritic shape is a crucial step towards the quantitative characterization of the structure-activity relationship in the nervous system and it constitutes an effective way to represent, compress, store, exchange, and amplify extremely complex neuroanatomical data. Neuroanatomical algorithms and models have been developed to simulate and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional structure of dendritic trees in the same format used to represent experimentally reconstructed neurons.      The specific aims of this project are: (1) to expand and improve neuroanatomically plausible algorithms of dendritic structure and development by including determinants of three-dimensional branch orientation and dependence of growth upon local and global influences (e.g. diameter and neuronal size, respectively); (2) to enhance and distribute the analysis, modeling, and data basing software in order to provide experimental and computational neuroscientists with web-based tools to query, retrieve, measure, classify, and synthesize dendritic morphology data; (3) to continue the experimental reconstruction and analysis of hippocampal pyramidal cells and spinal motoneurons with different experimental protocols and in early postnatal periods; and to integrate these data with detailed biophysical models of neuronal electrophysiology. The informatics and neuroscience components of this research are deeply intertwined and span a variety of scientific approaches, including ""wet"" experiments, computational simulations, statistical analysis and data mining.

"Systems analysis of oxygen regulation in Halobacterium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To withstand environmental onslaught, biological systems mount global programs to coordinate the induction of protection and repair mechanisms. This proposal poses the hypothesis that the transcriptional networks underlying such responses to diverse stressors are interrelated. Halobacterium, a halophilic archaeon, has been chosen as a model for this study because it routinely negotiates an array of adverse conditions in its extreme environment, including anoxia, metal stress, and radiation damage. This proposal will investigate the inter-relationship of these responses using global approaches. Given that basal genetic information processing pathways in Halobacterium are mediated by eukaryotic-like proteins, findings from this study will have a direct impact on understanding how complex eukaryotic organisms elicit orthogonal responses in disease-perturbed or infection states. Specifically, I will (1) Characterize key transcriptional regulators responsible for mediating responses to fluctuating oxygen concentrations and identify regulons under their direct and indirect control; (2) Through statistical analysis of integrated datasets, evaluate the extent of cross-regulation of the anoxic response with other environmental perturbations; (3) Experimentally test new hypotheses generated by statistical analysis.

"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets).

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7317856,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2007,335920,-0.02315400022478836
"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated.  Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC.

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7179328,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Condition', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Numbers', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Range', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Role playing therapy', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2007,362926,-0.020623190505406515
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,-0.007636586385275145
"Accelerating metabolic discovery using characterization data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop methods that will allow researchers to gain insight into the metabolic networks of organisms for which we have little or no high-throughput data. Such metabolic networks can reveal aspects of the organism's metabolism that might make it vulnerable to new or existing therapies. A core data set using genomic and other omic data from data-rich bacteria that are related to the organisms of interest will be assembled. The statistical tools needed to integrate these data and to infer metabolic networks using these core data plus characterization (phenotypic) data will then be built. Using the statistical inference algorithms, the characterization data can be leveraged to reveal the metabolic networks of data-poor bacteria for which we have only characterization data. This approach can eliminate the need for genome sequencing, gene expression experiments and the like for thousands of Gram-negative facultative rod bacteria (GNF). There are five tasks in the project: (1) assemble the data sets from data-rich organisms that will be used to inform the inference algorithm. These data include (a) the genomic sequences and annotation information, (b) extant pathway data and (c) gene expression data. All these data contain some level of information about the connectivity within the metabolic network; (2) process the genomic data to enhance its predictive value; (3) develop a data integration algorithm; (4) investigate modeling frameworks to be used for Bayesian data fusion and network inference; (5) validate the metabolic networks. Deliverables from this project should include: (1) a set of pathway genome databases for 35 GNF, This group includes 20 strains classified as category A or B biothreat agents, (2) a core dataset that integrates all the information we have relevant to the metabolic pathways in the 35 sequenced GNF, (3) a probabilistic graphical modeling framework capable of integrating disparate types of data and inferring networks from the integrated data, (4) a method for using characterization data, along with deliverables 2 and 3, to infer metabolic networks for bacterial strains for which we have only characterization data. The ability to rapidly construct models of metabolic networks means researchers will be able to respond to emerging infectious agents or biothreats more quickly. Relevance The methods developed as part of this proposal will allow us to quickly make metabolic maps for thousands of bacteria. Such maps can guide researchers to promising new targets for therapeutic or preventative measures against pathogenic bacteria. The fight against well-known pathogens and biothreat agents, as well as against new, emerging pathogens will be greatly aided by these tools.              n/a",Accelerating metabolic discovery using characterization data,7267998,R21AI067543,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Type Culture Collection', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriology', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bypass', 'Categories', 'Cholera', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gram&apos', 's stain', 'Infectious Agent', 'Information Networks', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Numbers', 'Nutritional', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plague', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Salmonella typhi', 'Shapes', 'Shigella', 'Shigella Infections', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Writing', 'Yersinia pestis', 'biothreat', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'design', 'falls', 'fight against', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'gram negative facultative rods', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal rods', 'routine Bacterial stain', 'sound', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,AMERICAN TYPE CULTURE COLLECTION,R21,2007,185677,0.0014357333812505624
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7287978,SC1GM081068,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Endopeptidases', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2007,247625,-0.01781612734141591
"Systems Biology of Cell Decision Processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The remarkable complexity of biological systems demands a systematic approach to their analysis.  The goal of this proposal is to establish an MIT Center of Excellence in Cell Decision Processes (CDP) around an interdisciplinary team of cell biologists, computer scientists and microsystems engineers tackling the systems biology of protein networks and signal transduction in mammalian cells. The basic hypothesis of the CDP Center is that understanding cell decision processes requires the development of network models that combine quantitative rigor with molecular detail. These models will be hybrids containing highly specific representations of critical reactions and abstract representations of the system as a whole. Effective models will endure and capture the accumulation of knowledge over time in a rigorous and portable format.  The CDP Center will follow a research paradigm that links systematic experiments and numerical modeling in a four-step feedback loop of manipulation-measurement-mining and modeling. The biological focus of the Center will be the signaling events that control apoptosis. The measurement of protein concentrations, modification state and activity will be undertaken for signaling molecules at many points in the apoptotic network. The measurements will then be analyzed using several modeling approaches ranging from highly specified to highly abstract.  To collect sufficient data for systematic modeling, the CDP Center will automate and standardize biochemical methods, develop compact array-based assays and design novel microfabricated devices with integrated microfluidics and label-free sensors. To organize and systematize the data, informatic methods will be developed that support rigorous approaches to inference. Finally, physico-chemical, structure-systems and Bayesian models will be used to generate biological hypotheses for experimental verification.

"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,7107923,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemistry', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dementia', 'enzyme mechanism', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'physiology', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2006,509027,-0.001383333167393729
"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,7082976,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,373483,-0.025655805837700617
"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,7068069,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2006,19532,-0.002399194320811514
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7119996,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2006,162000,-0.036209740895462646
"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7368654,R01DE017471,[' '],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2006,246436,-0.020623190505406515

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7099789,K25AI064625,"['Poxviridae disease', 'cytokine', 'model']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2006,27000,0.02336241383967176

"Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions. A CNN-based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) module makes toxicological predictions based only on structure-activity analyses; a second CNN/wavelet module makes independent toxicogenomic predictions using microarray data; and a third CNN/wavelet module makes toxicogenomic predictions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data. This multi-intelligent, three-module approach provides crosschecks to reduce false positives and false negatives while substantially increasing confidence in predictions relative to current computer-based toxicity prediction techniques. The resulting product could potentially become a primary tool used by (a) human health researchers, b) pharmaceutical companies for screening drugs early during development, c) companies designing/developing new chemicals and chemically treated materials, and (d) government organizations (e.g., military) for mission-related chemical deployments.

"Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Biochemical signal transduction is a        critical basic cellular process by which information travels from the receptors      on the surface of a cell to the nucleus where responses to the signals are           generated.

"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6694513,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemistry', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dementia', ' enzyme mechanism', ' functional /structural genomics', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' physiology', ' protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2003,556670,-0.001383333167393729
"Toxicological Evaluation Neuralnet Tools (TENT)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  YAHSGS' Toxicological Evaluation Neuralnet Tools (TEND is designed to advance the state-of-the-art in the prediction of toxicological end points for new or untested chemicals, drugs, and compounds. TENT deploys computational neural nets (CNN), innovative computational chemistry methods, and modem statistical regression methods into interactive modules that determine (a) a chemical's 3-D structure and physical chemistry properties, (b) Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships, (C) mechanistic modes leading to toxicological responses via microassay database analysis, and (d) a broad spectrum of toxicological properties via CNN 3-D structural similarity analyses. TENTs output includes physical chemistry properties, 3-D structure, predicted toxicological impacts, and confidence level associated with each. It is anticipated that TENT will become one of the primary tools used by (a) researchers in human health and toxicological fields, (b) pharmaceutical companies to screen out drugs early in the development process prior to expending hundreds of millions on clinical in vivo and in vitro testing, (C) by companies developing new chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemically treated materials to determine potential toxicological impacts including those caused by environmental changes during and after usage, (d) companies striving to show compliance with ISO 14000 for materials used in their products, and (e) federal and military organizations for chemicals and materials contemplated for use in their mission areas. Industry experts predict that the market for TENT-type tools and applications will reach $8 -$10 billion by 2006 and three times that amount by 2016. The benefits that the US should receive from TENT could include (a) a greatly enhanced understanding of potential toxicological impacts from pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and chemically treated materials (4 out of 5 chemicals in industrial use currently have not undergone adequate testing due to time and expense), (b) companies will avoid billions of dollars in clinical testing for chemicals and drugs that ultimately fail (the funds saved can be applied to the development of new and better materials that help mankind and the environment that might otherwise go unfunded), and (c) TENT can substantially reduce the number of laboratory animals used for clinical testing.   n/a",Toxicological Evaluation Neuralnet Tools (TENT),6550075,R43ES011918,"['alternatives to animals in research', ' chemical structure function', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' method development', ' microarray technology', ' molecular dynamics', ' neurotoxicology', ' statistics /biometry', ' three dimensional imaging /topography', ' toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R43,2003,84450,-0.013389669337326398

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals).

"Improving Quantum Chemistry Calculations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the functionality of our commercial quantum chemistry program, Q-Chem, to effectively treat molecules containing transition metals. This enhanced capability will provide Q-Chem's end-users with the ability to accurately model complex molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and catalysts of industrial importance. While remarkable progress has been made over the last several years in the accurate modeling of systems containing transition metals, current numerical methods for achieving SCF convergence in these systems are problematic at best, resulting in long execution times or, in some cases, complete failure to find a solution. However, a novel computational technique developed at Q-Chem has been shown to dramatically improve convergence for organic molecules with known SCF convergence problems. We propose to adapt this method for use with transition metals. Our goal is to achieve the same robust SCF convergence that is realized for most organic molecules, thereby greatly increasing productivity and extending the capability of scientists to study molecules such as enzymes and industrial catalysts. During Phase (I, our efforts will be to further extend Q-Chem's capability in the molecular biology arena. This proposal seeks to improve the quantum chemical treatment of molecular systems containing transition metals. Transition metal elements are essential to natural biological processes. The technology developed in this research will enable the computer modeling of those systems that are difficult to handle with the current methodologies and therefore increase of the applications of computational modeling. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Transition-metal elements play a vital role in biological systems.  The success of this project will improve the performance of modeling of transition-metal complexes and making the modelings possible for the systems that current algorithms fail.

"Colon Cancer Networks: Linking Modeling to Experiment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development of computational models of signal transduction pathways implicated in colon cancer is proposed. These models give insight into the pathway's dynamical behavior and elucidate their roles in activating known oncogenic target genes. The project will model the Ras Map Kinase signal transduction pathway, which plays a central role in the development of colon cancer. The methods utilized, which will be further developed, combine computational modeling with experiments so that unknown parameters in the model are constrained. The goal is to create accurate, predictive models by combining the forward modeling approach with experimental data. The computational and experimental processes developed can be applied to other pathways implicated in colon cancer.   Accurate computational models of signaling pathways will bring rational, predictive science to the drug discovery process and lead to effective therapies for colon cancer. These simulations will help pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies prioritize drug targets, test the effects of lead compounds, and focus and direct laboratory efforts.   Specific aims are (1) to develop a detailed mathematical and computational model of the Ras Map Kinase pathway; (2) to conduct experiments on pathway components to extract the data needed to constrain parameters in the model; (3) to use and devise optimization algorithms to constrain parameters in the model and (4) generate predictions from the model.

"Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Exact Logistic Regression   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Logistic regression is a very popular           model for the analysis of binary data with widespread applicability in the           physical, behavioral and biomedical sciences. Parameter inference for this           model is usually based on maximizing the unconditional likelihood function.          However unconditional maximum likelihood inference can produce inconsistent          point estimates, inaccurate p-values and inaccurate confidence intervals for         small or unbalanced data sets and for data sets with a large number of               parameters relative to the number of observations. Sometimes the method fails        entirely as no estimates can be found that maximize the unconditional                likelihood function. A methodologically sound alternative approach that has          none of the aforementioned drawbacks is the exact conditional approach in which      one generates the permutation distributions of the sufficient statistics for         the parameters of interest conditional on fixing the sufficient statistics of        the remaining nuisance parameters at their observed values. The major stumbling      block to this approach is the heavy computational burden it imposes. Monte           Carlo methods attempt to overcome this problem by sampling from the reference        set of possible permutations instead of enumerating them all. Two competing          Monte Carlo methods are network based sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo          (MCMC) sampling. Network sampling suffers from memory limitations while MCMC         sampling can produce incorrect results if the Markov chain is not ergodic or if      the process is not in the steady state. We propose a novel approach which            combines the network and MCMC sampling, draws upon the strengths of each of          them and overcomes their individual limitations. We propose to implement this        hybrid network-MCMC method in our LogXact software and as an external procedure      in the SAS system.                                                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  There is great demand for logistic regression software that can handle small, sparse or  unbalanced data sets by exact methods.  Our LogXact package is the only software that  can provide exact inference for data sets which are not ""toy problems"".  Yet even  LogXact quickly breaks down on moderate sized problems.

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.

"SELECTING AMONG MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF COGNITION DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  In mathematical modeling       of cognition, it is important to have well-justified criteria for choosing       among differing explanations (i.e., models) of observed data.  This project      investigates those criteria as well as their instantiation in five model         selection methods.                                                                                                                                                Two lines of research will be undertaken.  In the first, a thorough              investigation of model complexity will be conducted.  Comprehensive              simulations re intended to determine complexity's contribution to model fit      and to model selection.  An analytical solution will also be sought with the     hope of quantifying model complexity.                                                                                                                             The second line of work examines the utility of each of the five selection       methods in choosing among models in three topic areas in cognitive               psychology (information integration, categorization, connectionist               modeling), the end goal being to identify their merits and shortcomings.

"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators. This computational approach will be validated using in vitro testing and offers several advantages to identify potential novel or repurposed molecules as MCM including speed and cost-effectiveness.",MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems,10094026,R43ES031038,"['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Ache', 'Address', 'Adenosine', 'Adenosine A1 Receptor', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Chlorine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'In Vitro', 'Licensing', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Privatization', 'PubChem', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'computational toxicology', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'novel', 'pesticide poisoning', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary agents', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,124915,-0.02308703609535353
"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,10055938,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,155686,-0.01928238231545226
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,10020414,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,388750,0.0012370159266425985
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,10015315,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,312939,0.018918286335746715
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9878070,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,591130,-0.005993194926060121
"A New Paradigm for Systems Physiology Modeling: Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation with Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER) Many promising peripheral neuromodulation techniques have been proposed to treat lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction, but our lack of predictive models has forced the community (including the PI’s lab) to explore the vast parameter space of nerve targets, stimulation parameterizations, and electrode designs empirically in animal experiments by trial and error. This type of exploratory experimentation is the only current method of optimizing, personalizing, or discovering novel LUT neuromodulation techniques. Motivated by this clinical need, our long-term goal for this work is to predict the effects of neuromodulation on the LUT. To move toward this goal, we propose to develop a new modeling framework that integrates disparate biophysics models through machine learning, thereby emulating an entire organ system through a process we call Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation of Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER). We will develop and use the general BLADDER framework to create an organ-level model of the normal healthy LUT throughout its filling and voiding cycles, including non-volitional neural reflex control over the bladder and urethra. Our focus on neural reflex control and organ-level scales ensures that, if successful, the BLADDER LUT model will be poised to predict effects of neuromodulation using computational studies, which so far has been impossible due to the complexity of the LUT. The BLADDER framework unites multiple individual mechanistic models (each accounting for a component function of an organ system) by using deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) to learn the appropriate coupling dynamics linking each component model. The combination of mechanistic and machine learning models under a single framework allows us to harness the advantages of both: mechanistic models excel at interpretability but suffer from a lack of scalability (becoming intractable at the level of organ systems), while machine learning models are excellent at scale but lack generalizability and insights for hypothesis generation. The BLADDER framework will scale up mechanistic models to the level of systems physiology by linking tractable model components together using a supervisory RNN, allowing the BLADDER framework to deliver both interpretability and scale. We will draw on existing SPARC datasets in the cat (e.g., Bruns and Gaunt), existing publicly available data in rat, and generate new data in the rat to construct a training dataset for the supervisory RNN. We will further draw from already published small-scale mechanistic models, validated on human and animal data, for the mechanistic components of the BLADDER LUT model. The formal process of identifying these models and datasets, and checking their validity and robustness, will clearly reveal the deficits and strengths in our theoretical and experimental understanding of the LUT in a straightforward and rational way. We will use the 10 Simple Rules to vet mechanistic models for inclusion in the BLADDER LUT model and compile a public inventory for the neurourology community.

"The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a rigorously experimentally validated all-atom computational model of the cardiac thin filament (CTF) bound to myosin S1 which provides a unique and accessible platform to identify novel, high resolution disease mechanisms linked to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the prior funding period, we refined and extended our existing CTF computational model and successfully employed it to identify unique and clinically relevant allosteric disease mechanisms including HCM mutation-induced changes in myofilament Ca2+ kinetics, mutation-specific molecular causes of differential cardiac remodeling and disease progression. This included an in vivo validation via the development of a novel transgenic mouse model of cTnT-linked dilated cardiomyopathy and a predictive algorithm to determine the pathogenicity of cTnT mutations that out-performed existing computational approaches in a preliminary test. The key to these advances has been the ability of the current model to precisely identify and locate allosteric changes caused by mutations throughout all components of the CTF followed by closely coupled experimental validation and eventual in vivo model correlation. We now propose to significantly expand the biological complexity of the model to include myosin S1, the molecular motor that drives contraction and the second most common genetic cause of HCM. This important and challenging advance will facilitate a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis by, for the first time, incorporating the role of molecular allosteric mechanisms between myosin S1 and thin filament. This new computational – experimental platform will be used for both mechanistic insight (for example used for the identification of novel myofilament disease targets,) and the development of a comprehensive deep-learning predictive algorithm to assign pathogenicity to both myosin and thin filament HCM mutations. The latter represents the first use of high-resolution structure, dynamics and function to predict HCM disease allele pathogenicity, a central challenge in the clinical management of these complex patients. Both the training and testing components of the deep learning development will utilize data from the highly annotated and curated SHaRe HCM registry thus greatly improving translational power. Two Specific Aims will be pursued: Aim 1 will utilize state of the art rare event simulation methods developed in one of our groups and refinement of existing unstructured domains of the CTF via FRET to establish the new model. Aim 2 will employ an extensive program of computational analysis and subsequent in vitro validation using pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and non- pathogenic HCM alleles derived from SHaRe to provide inputs to the machine learning environment for algorithm development. Novel disease mechanisms for myosin and thin filament HCM that include crosstalk between the two components will also be explored. Elucidation of these mechanisms can be the basis for robust molecular approaches to disease. Precision medicine and “molecular” medicine are concepts that aim to employ a patient’s genetic structure to discern the best medical treatments for disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease that afflicts 1/500 people. This application translates our knowledge of the molecular level effects of cardiac tissue mutation to disease and will aim to lead to eventual treatment.",The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy,10071638,R01HL107046,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Breath Tests', 'C-terminal', 'Cardiac', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Differential Scanning Calorimetry', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Fluorescence Anisotropy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfilaments', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick Filament', 'Thin Filament', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'educational atmosphere', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inherited cardiomyopathy', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphorescence', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'response', 'simulation', 'stopped-flow fluorescence', 'success', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,585711,-0.02505148455973751
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary The success of the ongoing battle with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends crucially on the availability of effective diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutates slower than the viruses that cause the flu and the common cold, it has had more than 8300 observed single mutations on its genome of 29,900 nucleotides by June 1, 2020. We show that these mutations might have devastating effects on COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs (J. Chem. Inf. Model. In press). We will develop new artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast SARS-CoV-2 future mutations. Leveraging on state-of-art methods developed under the present R01 award, we will design mutation- resistant vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. The CPUs and GPUs requested in this supplement will be essential for my lab to continue the research of the present R01 award and to apply the methods developed in this award to attack fundamental problems in combating COVID-19. Project Narrative The project concerns the forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the design of mutation- resistant vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs using artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced mathematics.

"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10022122,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,67446,-0.025814074393728785
"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors. This work will provide a strong quantitative bridge between large-scale epidemiologic trends and deep biological profiling to investigate the complex mechanisms that govern the immune system in clinical settings.",Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings,10028766,R35GM138353,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Foundations', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteome', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genome analysis', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'response']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,382710,-0.008288951120292515
"Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10142097,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2020,67446,0.0030696644957258767
"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize small molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites provide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding of health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities associated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and advances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large majority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning partial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification can inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite annotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show in our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in machine-learning tasks such as annotation.  This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench by: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding characterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns (motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated with aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use variational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to identify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We generate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.  In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and as a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this mapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such a classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim 1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can be used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to generate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks. Relevance to Public Health The project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data set hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and information about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures. We anticipate that our techniques will result in annotating and adding information to the data set, which in turn will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset,10111982,R03OD030601,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gene Expression', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histidine', 'Human', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'cost', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'neural network', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool']",OD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2020,263120,-0.00036536768303419313
"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9989025,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,612684,-0.001011139111296604
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,9874005,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,360227,-0.001953362387213137
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal develops a technology platform that will enable automated microinjection of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded tools such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles, into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session.

"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis. This project will develop a novel integrated systems biology approach to elucidate mechanistically the molecular pathways and their coordination that control large-scale tissue growth dynamics in living organisms.

"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10131449,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'combat', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2020,457208,-0.014417268740385805
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets Complex biological processes, including organ development, immune response and disease progression, are inherently dynamic. Learning their regulatory architecture requires understanding how components of a large system dynamically interact with each other and give rise to emergent behavior. Recent experimental advances have made ii possible to investigate these biological systems in a data-driven fashion al high temporal resolution, allowing identification of new genes and their regulatory interactions. Longitudinal omics data sets are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice as well. Information on these collections of interacting genes can be integrated to gain systems-level insights into the roles of biological pathways and processes, including progression of diseases. Consequently, developing interpretable methods for learning functional relationships among genes, proteins or metabolites from high-dimensional time series data has become a timely research problem. The nature of these time-course data sets presents exciting opportunities and interesting challenges from a statistical perspective. Typical time-course omics data sets are challenging because of their high-dimensionality and non-linear relationships among system components. To tackle these challenges, one needs sophisticated dimension-reduction techniques that are biologically meaningful, computationally efficient and allow uncertainty quantification. Methods that incorporate prior biological information (e.g., pathway membership, protein-protein interactions) into the data analysis are good candidates for analyzing such high-dimensional systems using small samples. Here, we will develop three core methods to address the above challenges - (Aim 1): an empirical Bayes framework for clustering high-dimensional omics time-course data using prior biological knowledge; (Aim 2): a quantile-based Granger causality framework for learning interactions among genes or metabolites from their lead-lag relationships; and (Aim 3): a decision tree ensemble framework for searching cascades of interactions among genes from their temporal expression profiles. Our interdisciplinary team of statisticians and scientists will analyze time-course omics data from three research projects: (i) innate immune response systems in Drosophila, (ii) developmental process in mouse models, and (ii) longitudinal metabolite profiling of TB patients. These insights will be used to build and validate our methodology, which will be implemented in a publicly available software. This proposal is innovative in its incorporation of prior biological knowledge in the framework of novel dimension reduction techniques for interrogating high-dimensional time-course omics data. This research is significant in that it will impact basic sciences by elucidating data-driven, testable hypotheses on the regulatory architecture of biological processes, and clinical practice by monitoring disease progression and prognosis. n/a",Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets,10021429,R01GM135926,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Drosophila genus', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Grouping', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ growth', 'outcome forecast', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'temporal measurement']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,344345,-0.005104435762379107
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,9864299,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2020,465692,-0.004138859488054311
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10050030,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,535171,-0.001165244049549806
"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators. We seek to identify new and useful concepts to guide experimental designs of novel “non-natural” molecular systems (e.g., receptors, biosensors, and hydrogels) that have potential biomedical applications.",Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions,10016376,R35GM133548,"['Anions', 'Back', 'Biosensor', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Electrons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Hydrogels', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Plant Roots', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Research Proposals', 'System', 'Vision', 'Work', 'cheminformatics', 'density', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'quantum computing', 'receptor', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R35,2020,377200,0.00024889986712883886
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9889134,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,356625,-0.0177679210325259
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9981804,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'microSPECT', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,601275,0.006321742368667029
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9963295,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2020,65310,-0.005628031965893785
"Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes ABSTRACT As the rapidly unfolding COVID-19 pandemic claims its victims around the world, it has also inspired the scientific community to come up with solutions to meet an urgent and unmet need —i.e., ameliorate the severity of Covid- 19 and reduce mortality. Two obstacles make that task difficult—First, the pathophysiology of Covid-19 remains a mystery; the emerging reports generally agree that the disease has a very slow onset and that those who succumb typically mount a ‘cytokine storm’, i.e., an overzealous immune response. However, despite being implicated as a culprit behind the observed mortality and morbidity in COVID-19, we know virtually nothing about what constitutes (nature, extent) or contributes to (cell or origin) such an overzealous response. A significant number of patients have GI symptoms. The treatment goals in COVID-19 have been formulated largely as a ‘trial and error’-approach; this is reflected in the mixed results of the trials that have concluded. Second, the process of drug discovery is comprised of time-consuming steps; to avoid delays, we need to define the nature of the fatal cellular response before deciding how to model it in animals or matching therapeutics to curb it.  Our preliminary work has helped us define the aberrant host cellular response in COVID-19. We used machine learning tools that can look beyond interindividual variability to extract underlying gene expression patterns within complex data across multiple cohorts of viral pandemics, including COVID-19. The resultant pattern, i.e., signature, was subsequently exploited as a predictive model to navigate COVID-19 for GI symptoms. Surprisingly, the 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, inspiring the nomenclature-- (ViP)-signature. The ViP signature identified and predicted the disease severity of SARS-CoV2-infected patients. We hypothesized that the ViP signature provides a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the cellular response in viral pandemics and could serve as a powerful unbiased tool in our armamentarium to vet candidate drugs rapidly. In this proposal, our predicted model, experimental datasets and the information from published literature will be used to screen drugs/nutritional components/probiotics in the GI organoid derived monolayers in a semi-HTP format. We will experimentally validate the effect of the therapeutics predicted in ViP gene signature of the host. The following two aims will provide a translational impact on the COVID-19 emergency. Aim 1: Identify the gastro-intestinal pathogenic pathways during COVID-19. Aim 2: Determine the impact of drugs, nutrients and supplements in gut-in-a-dish model of COVID-19. Impact: This proposal will identify the gastro-intestinal pathways (in healthy and patients with chronic diseases) involved in the GI symptoms of COVID 19 and provide new treatment options in COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) continues to rapidly claim lives and challenge the limits of our knowledge and our healthcare system. Other than “cytokine storm,” a significant amount of the patient shows gastrointestinal symptoms and nothing is known for the cellular pathways and any relevant treatment of COVID-19. The published literature, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided approaches, and our experimental datasets with GI- organoid-based cell models are used to identify host gastrointestinal pathways that can be targeted using drug/pro-prebiotics and nutritional supplements to combat the disease.",Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes,10177672,R01DK107585,"['2019-nCoV', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'China', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'Duodenum', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enteral', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Esophagus', 'Feces', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'IL8 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Interleukin-15', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Lower Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nature', 'Nausea', 'Neutral Amino Acid Transport Systems', 'Nomenclature', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prodrugs', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'Rectum', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Intestines', 'Specimen', 'Stomach', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'VIP gene', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biosafety level 3 facility', 'cohort', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'dietary supplements', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'genetic signature', 'gut microbiota', 'ileum', 'intestinal epithelium', 'microbial', 'monolayer', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'prebiotics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'transmission process', 'viral RNA', 'virtual']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,354469,-0.013996373107830026
"Designing neutralization antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 Project Summary COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic whose rapid spread and mortality rate threatens millions of lives and the global economic system. Developing effective treatment such as neutralization antibodies is an urgent need. We propose here to develop a new method to design antibodies strongly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that is necessary for viral entrance to human cells. We will develop a novel approach that combines directed evolution, deep sequencing and interpretable neural network models to efficiently identify strong and specific antibodies. This method will allow analyzing large sequencing data sets of antibody variants against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in order to derive superior binders that do not exist in the original library. Iteration through directed evolution and computational design will efficiently identify neutralization antibody candidates that can be used as potent therapeutics to treat COVID-19.

"Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations Project Summary The spleen plays a key role in the human immune system but also clears senescent red blood cells (RBC) from the circulation and those altered by acquired or inherited diseases. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is one of the first targets of pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. Under hypoxic conditions, mutated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes to fibers which increase both the stiffness and adhesion of RBC. Splenic filtration of altered RBC prone to sickling (a process that cannot be directly observed in human subjects) contributes to anemia and likely triggers acute splenic sequestration crises (ASSC). On the other hand, it potentially prevents complications associated with intravascular sickling. Self- amplified blockade of vessels with sickled RBCs is indeed a hallmark of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and acute hepatic crises, that severely impact the life quality and expectancy of patients with SCD. We propose to formulate and validate a new predictive modeling framework for how the spleen filters altered RBC in SCD by synergistically integrating in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data using multifidelity-based neural networks (NN). This will deliver predictive models that can continuously learn when new data become available, a paradigm shift in biomedical modeling. We will develop multiscale/multifidelity computational models (and corresponding NN implementations) that link sub-cellular, cellular, and vessel level phenomena spanning across four orders of magnitude in spatio-temporal scales. This scale coupling will be accomplished using a molecular dynamics/dissipative particle dynamics (MD/DPD) framework. We will validate these predictive computational models by data from in vitro and ex vivo experiments, and RBC quantitative features collected in SCD patients. Specifically, we will use three new spleen-on-a-chip microfluidic devices with oxygen control and the unique human spleen perfusion setup of our foreign partner, with the following aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a splenic inter-endothelial slit filtration model; Aim 2: Develop new models of RBC macrophage adhesion and of phagocytosis in the spleen; Aim 3: Perform Spleen-on-a-Chip experiments and validation; Aim 4: Validate the predictive framework based on RBC samples from patients. Realization of our four Specific Aims will significantly increase our understanding of the complex pathogenic and protective roles of the spleen in SCD. Feeding our new multifidelity neural networks with morphological and functional measures of RBC circulating in SCD patients will lead to models for residual spleen function in SCD, which should help predict the risk of acute splenic sequestration crises, and guide optimal timing for Stem Cell Transplantation or Gene Therapy. The new paradigm in using deep learning tools to integrate data from different sources will be applicable to modeling many other blood diseases. Project Narrative In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is the target of early pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. We will formulate and validate predictive multiscale models for red blood cell (RBC) filtration by the spleen based on new deep learning neural networks fed with data from simulations, experiments using new spleen-mimetic microfluidics, and RBC quantitative features from ex vivo perfusion of human spleens and from SCD patients. These models will be used to predict acute splenic sequestrations crises and guide treatment decisions in patients with SCD.","Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations",10052044,R01HL154150,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adhesions', 'Adhesiveness', 'Adhesives', 'Anemia', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Endothelium', 'Erythrocytes', 'Expectancy', 'Fiber', 'Filtration', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hepatic', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hereditary Spherocytosis', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Paris, France', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phagocytosis', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Source', 'Spleen', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Surface', 'System', 'Training', 'Validation', 'acute chest syndrome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'ex vivo perfusion', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'learning progression', 'macrophage', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neural network', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'retention rate', 'senescence', 'sickling', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'vaso-occlusive crisis']",NHLBI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,705243,-0.02034676490458878
"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",9897100,R01GM111645,"['Active Sites', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enzymatic Biochemistry', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical chemistry', 'cofactor', 'computer studies', 'design', 'electron density', 'enzyme mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular scale', 'movie', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'protein structure', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'synthetic biology', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,335664,-0.02153624896455378
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers.

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,0.009208294839166652
"Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three- dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A) understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:  1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a  label free and non-invasive manner  2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures  3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.  4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens. If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell— pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle, mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens. This proposed development of vibrational sum frequency generation microscopy, in the short term, will spatially resolve collagen tissues with chemical structure and molecular interaction information in a complicated environment. Machine learning and simulation approaches will be employed to build a data base to convert hyperspectral images of collagen into a spatial map with microscopic structures and molecular interaction information. In the long term, the fundamental biochemical knowledge learned from this development will lay foundations for rationally design biomedical approaches to monitor and control pericellular spaces and its interaction with cells, and further advance treatment to diseases related to it.",Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,10028946,R35GM138092,"['3-Dimensional', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Collagen Fibril', 'Collagen Type I', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Peptides', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Water', 'biophysical techniques', 'design', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'self assembly', 'simulation', 'vibration']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2020,393958,-0.019509320259083956
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health. The research described here will enable a deeper understanding of disease-related microbial systems and help to formulate strategies to combat diseases.",Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space,10029526,R35GM138241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Devices', 'Dioxygen', 'Disease', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Nanoarray Analytical Device', 'Nature', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Transition Elements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'combat', 'extracellular', 'gut microbiota', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'microorganism culture', 'nano', 'nanomaterials', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2020,371084,0.0012617305752401972
"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome.

Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators.

"Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Field for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Molecular simulation is a powerful tool to predict the properties of biomolecules, interpret biophysical experiments, and design small molecules or biomolecules with therapeutic utility. However, a number of obstacles have impeded the development of quantitative, cloud-scale research workﬂows involving biomolecular simulation. Two main ob- stacles are the insufﬁcient accuracy of current atomistic models for biomolecules and small molecule therapeutics and the lack of interoperability in simulation toolchains used in both academic and industrial biomolecular research. Our original R01, “Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Fields for Predictive Bio- physics and Drug Design,” seeks to solve the ﬁrst problem. It helps fund our effort, the Open Force Field Initiative (https://openforceﬁeld.org) to develop open, extensible, and shared software and data infrastructure, implementing statistically robust methods of parameterizing force ﬁelds and choosing new force ﬁelds in a statistically sound manner. This work is designed to create not just a new generation of force ﬁelds, but an open technology to continue advancing force ﬁeld science. However, even with improved molecular models, putting together complete workﬂows of biomolecular simulations involves interfacing substantial numbers of different tools. However the majority of the existing molecular simulation workﬂows are mutually incompatible, with differing representations of the molecular models. The Open Force Field Initiative effort already includes the development of molecular data structures that we can ex- port into existing molecular simulation tools. We propose to extend the existing scope of our R01 to create an extensible common molecular simulation representation and translators to and from this representation. Such a set of tools will immediately make it signiﬁcantly easier to combine the disparate workﬂows developed for different sets of molecular simulation tools. Researchers will be able to set up and build the biophysical simulations using their usual tools, but run and analyze them with currently incompatible tools, enabling better matching of computational resources and methods to problems. It will help avoid trapping in a single software framework, and enable combinations of functionalities previously impossible without substantial developer time and effort. We will (Aim 1) work with partners to generalize our modular, extensible object model for representing parameterized biomolecular systems in a manner that accommodates the force ﬁeld terms currently supported by most popular biomolecular simulation packages. We will engineer it to be extensible to advanced interaction forms, such as polarizability and other multibody terms, and machine learning models for intermolecular forces. We will (Aim 2): enable easy conversion between components of molecular simulation workﬂows by allowing other molecular simulation packages to easily store their representations in this data model, developing converters that can import/export this object model to multiple popular ﬁle formats, focusing initially on OpenMM, AMBER, CHARMM, and GROMACS. We will demonstrate the utility of this interface in cloud-ready workﬂows. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life carry out their functions and to design new medications. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms. This supplement will make it much easier for molecular simulation workﬂows to interoperate with each other in large-scale workﬂows.",Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Field for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design,10166314,R01GM132386,"['Affinity', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'COVID-19', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Framework', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomaterial interface', 'computing resources', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'molecular modeling', 'open data', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2020,225000,-0.0087574923143685
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,9950635,R01AI150745,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Cavia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Ferrets', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamsters', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Information Systems', 'Lasso', 'Lung', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Serological', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'animal data', 'animal model development', 'cohort', 'efficacy testing', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'human model', 'imprint', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse development', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'novel', 'preclinical evaluation', 'product development', 'research and development', 'response', 'safety study', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,ST.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,9895377,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein profiling', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2020,239725,0.004897751814078259
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America.

"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps.

"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9934213,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,310328,-0.019677171548281684
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome. The proposed research introduces the first molecular tools to precisely understand the functions of microbiome communities in our health and disease in order to then delineate therapeutic interventions for diseases mediated by the gut microbiota, thereby addressing NIH's public health mission.",Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities,10029354,R35GM138201,"['Address', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioreactors', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Encyclopedias', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'fundamental research', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo evaluation', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'molecular dynamics', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'quantum', 'real time monitoring', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'targeted agent', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R35,2020,342713,0.016899959416026566
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9982190,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,1239304,-0.019129618744452678
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we willl bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This supplement to the original RO1 is to purchase a small GPU cluster to enable rapid prototyping of many of the approaches that are proposed in this project outlined in the four aims.

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,10004647,UH3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endothelium', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UH3,2020,1000,-0.021309280373841975
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,-0.0017288099037321672
"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,9888378,K25DK115904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Columnar Epithelium', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal Tissue', 'Esophagitis', 'Esophagus', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Squamous Epithelium', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'computer framework', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'injury and repair', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'standard of care', 'stem cells', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational scientist', 'translational study']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K25,2020,171720,0.007928336841468762
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies.

"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in

have discovered potent antimicrobial activities of existing antibiotics against highly “drug­resistant superbugs”  that are currently ignored but revealed in synergy with the human immune system. This program proposes a

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

The Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Treatment (SCRIPT) systems biology center seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including severe viral pneumonia. We will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients to generate clinical phenomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data that describe the host response, pathogen characteristics and microbiome of the alveolar space during pneumonia. We will then integrate this comprehensive phenotypic data into an ecosystem-based model to generate predictive biomarkers of pneumonia outcome for subsequent validation in a second cohort and tested for causality in a humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model.",Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center,9843971,U19AI135964,"['Acinetobacter', 'Address', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Alveolus', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Viruses', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fungal DNA', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data management', 'data pipeline', 'deep sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'hazard', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neural network', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'pneumonia model', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'viral DNA', 'whole genome']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U19,2020,2400000,0.004898516743252934
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy Summary In the past decade, we have witnessed a revolutionary progress in camera technology and the attainable resolution of macromolecular assemblies via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting 3D maps to atomic resolution structures. Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,10120245,R01GM062968,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoreceptors', 'Chimera organism', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Cryo-electron tomography', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydration status', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'density', 'electron tomography', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'fundamental research', 'heuristics', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'macromolecular assembly', 'novel', 'particle', 'prevent', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'structured data', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,313572,-0.016931758379450212
"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,9950738,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1202266,-0.00668795818885894
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,10026026,F31NS113385,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Endoscopes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Postural adjustments', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Stereotyping', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'calcium indicator', 'complement pathway', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'indexing', 'microendoscopy', 'miniaturize', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2020,33352,-0.019412758531542198
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9921415,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,514429,-0.027933694483474072
"Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence Abstract Enzyme functionality is a critical component of all life systems. Whereas advances in experimental methodology have enabled a better understanding of factors that control enzyme function, critical components of the reaction space such as highly unstable intermediates and transition states are best accessed for evaluation through computational simulations. Similarly, computational methodology continues to provide a key resource for probing excited-state processes such as bioluminescence. Combined ab initio quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) simulations are, in principle, the preferred choice in the modeling of both processes. But ai-QM/MM modeling of enzymatic reactions is now severely limited by its computational cost, where a direct ai-QM/MM free energy simulation of an enzymatic reaction can take 500,000 or more CPU hours. Meanwhile, ai-QM/MM modeling of firefly bioluminescence is also hindered by the computational accuracy, where it has yet to produce quantitatively correct predictions for the bioluminescence spectral shift with site-directed mutagenesis. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate ai-QM/MM simulations of enzymatic reaction free energy and to improve the quality of ai-QM/MM-simulated bioluminescence spectra, so that ai-QM/MM simulations can be routinely performed by experimental groups. This will be achieved via a) using a lower-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian for sampling; b) an enhancement to the similarity between the two Hamiltonians by calibrating the low-level Hamiltonian using the reaction pathway force matching approach, in conjunction with several other methods. The expected outcomes of this collaborative effort include: a) advanced methodologies for accelerated reaction free energy simulations and accurate bioluminescence spectra predictions, which will be released through multiple software platforms; b) a fundamental understanding of reactions such as Kemp elimination and polymerase-eta catalyzed DNA replication; c) a deeper insight into the role of macromolecular environment in the modulation of enzyme catalytic activities or bioluminescence wavelengths, which can further enhance our capability of designing new enzymes and bioluminescence probes. Narrative This project aims to develop quantum-mechanics-based computational methods to more quickly model enzymatic reactions and more accurately model bioluminescence spectra. It will lead to reliable and efficient computational tools for use by the general scientific community. It will facilitate the probe of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the computer-aided design of new bioluminescence probes.",Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence,10021018,R01GM135392,"['Adopted', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioluminescence', 'Calibration', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Fireflies', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Ions', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multi-scale modeling', 'mutant', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2020,255238,0.004343030739365658
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks.

"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9991796,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal condition', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,645963,0.014360344366283083
"Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics Abstract Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics, organized by Drs. Jose M. Lora and Timothy K. Lu. The conference will be held in Breckenridge, Colorado from March 29- April 1, 2019. Synthetic Biology tools and principles have matured tremendously over the last decade and have reached extraordinary levels of sophistication, both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Synthetic biology as a therapeutic modality is starting to enter multiple clinical studies and has the potential to have a significant impact on medicine across a wide range of diseases (e.g., metabolic, immune-mediated, cancer, and neurologic diseases). This Keystone Symposia conference will delve into the field of synthetic biology with a special emphasis on its applications to medicine. While there are conferences that capture synthetic biology in only a few talks mixed in among other various topics, there is a paucity of conferences focused on synthetic biology as drugs to treat disease. However, due to the rapid pace of fundamental scientific advances along with an expanding number of biotechnology companies and emerging clinical studies with synthetic biology at their core, this conference will be highly relevant for a wide audience of scientists both from academia and industry. In addition, other meetings in this field have a highly technology-driven focus on synthetic biology techniques with relatively little attention given to biological and medical context. Ultimately, this Keystone Symposia conference should inspire researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss synthetic biology via many new angles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, tremendous advances have been made in the use of biological parts to engineer systems that can effectively direct living cells for a vast variety of purposes (a.k.a. synthetic biology). Synthetic biology is being used to construct more effective therapies in diseases such as cancer, but there are remaining obstacles to the clinical translation of these therapies.

"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS Network models are used to investigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, but rather than assuming that the members of a population of interest are fully mixed, the network approach enables individual-level specification of contact patterns by considering the structure of connections among the members of the population. By representing individuals as nodes and contacts between pairs of individuals as edges, this network depiction enables identification of individuals who drive the epidemic, allows for accurate assessment of study power in cluster- randomized trials, and makes it possible to evaluate the impact of interventions on the individuals themselves, their partners, and the broader network. There are currently two major mathematical paradigms to the modeling of networks: the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one specifies a model that states the likelihood of observing a given network, whereas in the mechanistic approach one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules at the level of individual nodes, the actors in the network, that are used to evolve the network over time. Given that mechanistic models directly model individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – they are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Another attractive feature of mechanistic models is their scalability as they can be implemented for networks consisting of thousands or even millions of nodes, making it possible to simulate population-wide implementation of interventions. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has however impeded their use in real-world settings, a limitation that stems from the fact that there are typically no closed-form likelihood functions available for these models due the exponential increase in the number of ways, as a function of network size, of arriving at a given observed network. We propose to overcome this gap by advancing inferential and model selection methods for mechanistic network models, and by developing a framework for investigating their similarities with statistical network models. We base our approach on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a family of methods developed specifically for settings where likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Our specific aims are the following. Aim 1: To develop a statistically principled framework for estimating parameter values and their uncertainty for mechanistic network models. Aim 2: To develop a statistically principled method for model choice between two competing mechanistic network models and estimating the uncertainty surrounding this choice. Aim 3: To establish a framework for mapping mechanistic network models to statistical models. We also propose to implement these methods in open source software, using a combination of Python and C/C++, to facilitate their dissemination and adoption. We believe that the research proposed here can help harness mechanistic network models – and with that leverage some of the insights developed in the network science community over the past decade and more – to help eradicate this disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network models are used to gain a more precise understanding of human behavioral factors associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS in order to develop more effective interventions to halt the epidemic. There are two main mathematical paradigms for modeling networks, the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach, and given that the latter directly models individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – mechanistic models are a natural fit for infectious diseases.

"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease. Model-guided microbiome engineering has the potential to transform human medicine and is becoming increasingly important as scientists continue to discover connections between the microbiome and human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have shown close connections between the human gut microbiome and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. While engineering of the gut microbiome holds tremendous potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CVD, we currently lack the tools and methodology required to design interventions that precisely shift the structure and function of the gut microbiome.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,-0.026461858993764777
"MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan PROJECT SUMMARY Macronutrients serve a multitude of roles beyond provision of energy, with numerous nutrients and/or their downstream metabolites acting as signaling molecules to coordinate cellular metabolism and function. Indeed, numerous nutrient sensing pathways (e.g. mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins) have evolved allowing us to respond to specific nutrients/metabolites, which in turn impacts healthspan. Sirtuins are largely thought to be driven by redox, whereby high levels of NAD, a cofactor in the sirtuin reaction and indicator of low energy charge, drives sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation of target proteins. SIRT1, the most-studied sirtuin, is a key nutrient sensing node that regulates a plethora of cellular functions to promote lifespan extension and healthy aging. As a result, there is immense interest in the use of SIRT1 activating compounds (STACs) to prevent or treat a wide range of aging-related disease. The links between dietary macronutrients, nutrient sensing and healthspan have historically focused upon caloric or protein restriction with limited attention given to dietary lipids. However, a small and growing body of literature has linked monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to improved healthspan. In addition to positive effects on lifespan and healthy aging in model organisms, dietary MUFAs have been linked to wide-ranging health benefits in epidemiological studies and, since they are a primary constituent of olive oil, thought to contribute to the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Despite these studies, little is known about the biological underpinnings through which MUFAs elicit their beneficial health effects. We have previously shown that lipid droplet catabolism (i.e. lipolysis) increases SIRT1 and downstream PGC-1a/PPAR- a signaling as a means to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function during times of nutrient deprivation. Our preliminary data show for the first time that MUFAs released specifically from lipolysis are trafficked to the nucleus where they allosterically activate SIRT1 towards select acetylated peptide substrates. This discovery makes MUFAs the first-known endogenous allosteric activators of SIRT1. Moreover, we show that MUFAs activate SIRT1 through a similar mechanism to resveratrol suggesting that MUFA signaling may modulate the response to exogenous SIRT1 activators. Based on these preliminary data, the objective of this application is to further characterize the role of MUFAs as endogenous SIRT1 activators. We hypothesize that MUFAs selectively activate SIRT1 to modulate the response to numerous dietary interventions known to impact healthspan. To test our objective, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To define how MUFAs modulate SIRT1 substrate selectivity. Aim 2: To characterize the SIRT1-dependent effects of MUFAs/olive oil on healthspan. Aim 3: To determine the contribution of MUFAs in mediating the response to STACs or caloric restriction. Upon completion of the proposes studies, we will have further expanded our understanding of SIRT1 biology allowing for refined approaches to activate SIRT1 to promote healthy aging. NARRATIVE The proposed studies will advance our understanding into the underlying biology linking dietary factors to healthspan. The data gleaned from these studies will help refine therapeutic or nutritional avenues to modulate lifespan and aging-related diseases resulting in a direct, positive impact on human health.",MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan,10092409,R01AG069768,"['Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Catabolism', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deacetylation', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fasting', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipolysis', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monounsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Mus', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oils', 'Olive oil preparation', 'Olives - dietary', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'PPAR alpha', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resveratrol', 'Role', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sirtuins', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cofactor', 'deacylation', 'detection of nutrient', 'epidemiology study', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'middle age', 'mutant mouse model', 'novel', 'nutrient deprivation', 'polyphenol', 'prevent', 'red wine', 'response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,315700,-0.007135292135966486
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10056490,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,281780,0.019730803856084497

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9852330,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,178949,0.008907374929866322
"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM).

"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9892997,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'lipid metabolism', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10019521,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2020,1832307,0.006232808508458374
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,10090262,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,38074,-0.019929275838431047
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,-0.029186154098163854
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering.

"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion.

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties ABSTRACT Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have broad-based potential in regenerative medicine cell therapies and can be isolated from a variety of different tissues. Though MSCs from different tissues are phenotypically similar, a barrier to their clinical use is the high variability of their trophic and regenerative properties. This variability suggests that inherent differences exist in the molecular machinery guiding MSC properties between different MSC populations, yet, to date, these differences are ill-defined. To this end, we have preliminary evidence that MSC phenotypes correlate to their regenerative outcomes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how the molecular and cellular properties of distinct MSC populations determine their regenerative properties. Our hypothesis is that MSCs from different tissues have different regenerative properties which correlate to specific molecular profiles defined by gene expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, the project proposed has three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will determine how tissue-specificity dictates gene expression and dynamic transcription factor activity of distinct MSCs. SA2 will determine how differences in the cellular and molecular properties of MSCs correlate to MSC phenotype. Finally, in SA3, we will determine how the molecular profiles and cellular activities of MSCs dictate their regenerative properties. Findings of the proposed study will provide novel insights about how the distinct molecular profiles of MSCs dictate their biological and physiological properties. In a therapeutic context, this would enable the development of innovative screening technologies for MSC therapies to identify and enrich for the most appropriate MSC for the specific therapeutic application. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Stem cell therapies are emerging as a new treatment approach to regenerate lost tissues, treat ischemic disorders, and treat chronic inflammatory conditions. Many of these approaches use stem cells from adults which are present in various regions throughout the body. Our research team is working to better understand how and why these adult stem cells behave the way they do so that we can better determine how to use them in different therapies to treat debilitating health conditions.",Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties,9954044,R01DE028657,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Pulp', 'Development', 'Disease', 'ENG gene', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gingiva', 'Health', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscle', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Osteogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'alveolar bone', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'healthy volunteer', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular phenotype', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oral tissue', 'osteogenic', 'population based', 'regenerative', 'regenerative therapy', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell population', 'stem cell therapy', 'stem cells', 'stemness', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,405389,-0.030973110555750322
"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10029718,R01DK125407,"['ABCB1 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apical', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Colitis', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethanolamines', 'Eubacterium', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'P-Glycoprotein', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Submucosa', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Work', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'arm', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'commensal bacteria', 'design', 'efflux pump', 'first responder', 'healing', 'host colonization', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innate immune mechanisms', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'mathematical model', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'nuclear factor 1', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'theories', 'transcriptomics']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,560048,-0.02245391844237876
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9966951,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2020,184375,-0.018120355102846025
