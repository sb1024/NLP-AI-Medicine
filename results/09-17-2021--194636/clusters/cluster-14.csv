"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2.

"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9717421,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2019,110387,0.09228924007611268
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,9721392,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2019,226659,0.10367697998746431
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9774239,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2019,335245,0.021678420242369295
"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9701928,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'enteric infection', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'infection risk', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,183750,0.050021767196276774
"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Asses', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Custom', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA amplification', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidics', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory distress', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'microbiome research', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'plasmid DNA', 'premature', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,0.08929716166932102
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9788340,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2019,228089,0.06750953120346567
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9697702,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'convolutional neural network', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response', 'supervised learning']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2019,223354,0.05669515779855872
"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them.

"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,9785812,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2019,1085000,0.06460570647046154
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9759874,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2019,399937,0.12275841009735368
"CNS Viral Escape in HIV-infected Adults Project Summary The goal of this project is to understand mechanisms leading to CNS viral escape in HIV-infected adults on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, particularly the role of drug resistance. Despite current antiretroviral therapies (ART), viral escape in CSF is estimated to occur in 4-20% of patients with plasma suppression, representing a barrier to HIV cure. Factors associated with CSF escape include low-level viremia, prior virologic failure, low CD4 nadir, and long duration of HIV infection, but underlying mechanisms and influence of ART drug CNS penetration, drug resistance mutations (DRMs), size of the brain reservoir, and neuroinflammation on CSF escape remain unclear. M184V/I, which confers resistance to FTC/3TC, is the most common nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) DRM detected in blood. Preliminary studies showed M184V/I was frequently detected in patients with CSF escape despite plasma suppression, often detected together with thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs) in CSF. Moreover, we demonstrated a significant association between protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART regimens and CSF escape in patients with plasma suppression. Given low CNS penetration of PIs, patients with plasma M184V/I, particularly those on PI-based ART including tenofovir, have increased risk of CSF escape as a consequence of inadequate CNS penetration of ART regimens when M184V/I is present, leading to incomplete suppression of myeloid cell reservoirs in brain while selecting for TAMs and other DRMs in the CNS. To investigate these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well-characterized cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize viral reservoirs in plasma, CSF, and brain for evidence of ongoing viral replication, profile DRMs in the RT, PR, and IN genes, and evaluate neuroinflammatory and blood-brain barrier biomarkers in patients with CSF escape. These studies will provide important insights into causes of CNS viral escape that are relevant for optimizing clinical management and overcoming obstacles to HIV cure. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to understand mechanisms leading to viral escape in the CNS in HIV-infected adults with plasma suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly the role of drug resistance.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9657637,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2019,1697054,0.1896278337006458
"Mighty Girls and the Mighty Moment App:  Leveraging Innovative Technology, Narrative Theory, and Social Media to Empower Young Girls to Resist Peer Pressure to Engage in Risky Behavior The goal of this SBIR Phase I is to prevent risky sexual behaviors among young female adolescents in order to reduce negative outcomes such as early pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. To accomplish this goal, we propose using state-of-the-art technology to develop a scalable and multicultural version of the efficacious Mighty Girls program and evaluate its usability and feasibility. Early sexual initiation remains costly to individuals, families, and society. However, development of effective sex education curricula for early adolescence has been inhibited by a lack of prevention science strategies and political issues. In answer to these challenges, Norris and Hecht/REAL Prevention created Mighty Girls (MG), a brief sexual-pressure resistance curriculum grounded in Social Cognitive Theory and the Communication Competence Model and guided by Narrative Engagement Theory. MG was developed with parents, public school educators, Planned Parenthood, and the clergy, and has demonstrated efficacy in a state with an abstinence only policy for sex and HIV prevention education. MG can be implemented as a stand-alone or component of any sex education curriculum regardless of local politics because of its focus on peer resistance and decision making. The curriculum consists of 6 brief lessons that can be taught during or after school and an interactive videogame to teach sexual pressure resistance, improve self-efficacy, and motivate resistance. However, the program targets only Latinas and technology has not adequately advanced to take the game component to scale without prohibitive costs. Hence, we propose to develop a scalable, multicultural version that relies on a narrative app, Mighty Moment, in lieu of the interactive videogame. Phase I will establish usability and appeal of the multicultural curriculum version and the app, both of which will be developed through formative work involving a multi-racial/ethnic group of 7th grade girls, and review of the evidence-based multicultural keepin’ it REAL curriculum and current literature. Additionally, the Mighty Moment app prototype will be developed in collaboration with Tapp Technologies, a leading innovator in health promotion technology. This app will guide girls in creating and narrating a story about being “Mighty” (using their “Mighty Girls” powers to resist sexual pressure without making enemies of the initiator). Phase II will evaluate MG program efficacy after incorporating social media, with girls’ stories submitted to Storybooth.Com to be selected for animation and posting on their website where such animations receive over 40 million views, creating a powerful mechanism for dissemination of peer resistance stories and intervention messages. Efficacy of the existing intervention, need for risky sex reduction interventions that surmount political barriers, and REAL Prevention’s success in commercializing health interventions through partnerships with 4-H clubs, Planned Parenthood, and D.A.R.E. America argue for the proposed project’s promise. Project findings also lay the foundation for developing a similar program for boys. This Phase I SBIR will develop and demonstrate the usability/feasibility of a multicultural adaptation Mighty Girls, an effective program for reducing risky sexual behavior among 12-14- year-old girls, that harnesses the power of mobile technology and social media using a novel story writing app. The adaptation will make Mighty Girls easily scalable as either a stand-alone or a component of school- or community-based curriculum, and capable of reaching millions of youth a year. Mighty Girls is unique from other sex and HIV prevention programs because it focuses on decision making and resisting the peer pressure that leads to risky sexual behavior, skills that are valued equally by communities that want abstinence only and communities that want abstinence plus sex education.","Mighty Girls and the Mighty Moment App:  Leveraging Innovative Technology, Narrative Theory, and Social Media to Empower Young Girls to Resist Peer Pressure to Engage in Risky Behavior",9844786,R43NR018977,"['14 year old', 'AIDS prevention', 'Abstinence', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clergy', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ethnic group', 'Family', 'Female Adolescents', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Phase', 'Planned Parenthood Federation of America', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention education', 'Prevention program', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Puppet', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Service setting', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'animation', 'base', 'boys', 'brief intervention', 'commercialization', 'computer game', 'cost', 'digital', 'early adolescence', 'early pregnancy', 'early sex initiation', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'girls', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'meetings', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'school district', 'seventh grade', 'sex', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'societal costs', 'success', 'theories', 'usability', 'web site']",NINR,"REAL PREVENTION, LLC",R43,2019,224943,-0.029790090119933593
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9564155,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2018,335245,0.021678420242369295
"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9436228,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,220500,0.050021767196276774
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9646469,K08CA234458,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,68267,0.06750953120346567
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9455026,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,263805,0.05669515779855872
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9571234,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,550445,0.12275841009735368
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9475020,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2018,2147606,0.055453604847726025
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9382414,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2017,335245,0.021678420242369295
"Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) PROJECT SUMMARY In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned its highest antibiotic resistance threat level to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all routinely used antibiotics with gram-negative coverage and have been implicated in several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks in United States (U.S.) facilities. Although in past outbreaks institutions have deployed aggressive and highly bundled responses, this “kitchen sink” approach is unlikely to be resource- or cost-effective as CRE become endemic in the U.S. Evidence-based CRE policies are necessary, but fundamental gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in CRE, which are broadly classifiable by whether carbapenem resistance does (“CP-CRE”) or does not (“non-CP-CRE”) arise from carbapenemase production. Until recently resistance testing was limited in clinical settings, but this landscape is changing with the rollout of commercially available assays for identifying carbapenemase production. However, data on the prevalence of CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in U.S. patients, especially among high-risk hospitalized populations, are limited. Moreover, some evidence suggests that propensity for intra-facility spread differs between CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE, but rigorous data are lacking. Evaluating epidemiological differences in CRE resistance types is essential to establishing public health priorities for CRE prevention in U.S. healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will evaluate the prevalence of and pre-admission risk factors for rectal colonization with CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in a cohort of approximately 1900 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and comprehensive transplant unit (CTU) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Risk factors will be analyzed with machine learning methodologies in order to develop a user-friendly decision tree to identify patients at high-risk of CP-CRE and/or non-CP-CRE carriage for future targeted surveillance screening. Aim 2 will utilize serially collected rectal swabs, in conjunction with clinical and environmental data, to estimate the incidence of nosocomial CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE colonization and to evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic CRE carriers and individual-level risk factors on a patient's risk of CRE acquisition during unit hospitalization. Strain-typing and other analyses as needed (e.g., whole genome sequencing) will be available to ascertain transmission events. This will be the first study in a U.S. hospital to investigate CRE spread associated exclusively with asymptomatic carriers and stratified by resistance type in a non-outbreak setting. The broad, long-term goals of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the epidemiology of CRE colonization and the implications of CRE resistance mechanisms to routes of nosocomial acquisition in order to guide CRE control policies and resource prioritization in U.S. healthcare facilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Understanding the infection control implications of this heterogeneity has assumed newfound relevance with the rollout of resistance mechanism assays to identify carbapenemase production. The proposed research seeks to examine whether risk factors for CRE colonization and propensity for organism spread in the hospital environment differ by CRE resistance type, in order to promote evidence-based strategies for CRE control in U.S. hospitals.",Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),9267654,R36HS025089,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2017,41785,0.13164547599175225
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9241329,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,195000,0.10194139235181042
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy.

"Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a 5 year training program with the long-term goal of the candidate developing into an independent academic investigator with a research focus in hypertension in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease. The candidate will build on a background in clinical research developed during a comprehensive research fellowship spent studying ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial cell dysfunction in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The career development objectives are to obtain skills in designing and conducting prospective clinical research studies, learn statistical models to analyze ambulatory blood pressure in hemodialysis patients, gain experience in measuring and interpreting cardiovascular physiologic parameters including extracellular water and vascular resistance utilizing bioimpedance analysis, and participate in scholarly activities to facilitate te transition into an independent investigator. These will be applied immediately to investigating how extracellular volume and mediators of vascular resistance affect ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 1 will use a case control design to compare differences in extracellular water in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 2 will determine how extracellular volume, vasoconstrictor mediators of vascular resistance, and vascular resistance itself modify ambulatory blood pressure and the ambulatory blood pressure slope in these two groups. In aim 3, the candidate will gain experience in designing and conducting a randomized trial by comparing the effects of carvedilol vs. prazosin on ambulatory blood pressure, vascular resistance, and mediators of vascular resistance in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The candidate will develop these skills with the support a primary mentor, 3 co-mentors (including one translational research cardiologist and one biostatistician), and a research advisory committee with extensive experience in multiple research disciplines. The candidate and his advisors are located at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a leading academic medical center with substantial physical and intellectual resources necessary for the career development of young investigators and the performance of cutting-edge research. The candidate will take advantage of numerous courses and research activities as a Clinical Research Scholar in the Department of Clinical Sciences that will promote the overall development of his career. Consistent with the candidate's long term career goals, the findings from this study can be broadened to studying hypertension in hemodialysis patients in general. Understanding the relationship between extracellular volume, vascular resistance, and ambulatory blood pressure will provide the opportunity to investigate how pharmacologic therapies affect each component and how this can improve cardiovascular outcomes in hemodialysis patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In hemodialysis patients, high blood pressure increases the risk for death and complications related to heart disease. This research studies how hemodynamic changes during dialysis are associated with high blood pressure measured throughout the entire 44 hour period between dialysis treatments. Findings from this project will direct future studies that investigate which medications or interventions will most successfully lower blood pressure and reduce adverse events in hemodialysis patients.",Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension,9303381,K23DK096007,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Angiotensin II', 'Award', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Water', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Discipline', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impedance Cardiography', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prazosin', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrafiltration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular resistance', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Water', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'career', 'career development', 'carvedilol', 'case control', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'mortality', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trial comparing', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDDK,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2017,159840,0.07648802323217603
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.            ",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9017369,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical sequencing', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,234000,0.10194139235181042

"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,9020203,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,181875,0.0711115966636724

"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.            ",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,8881522,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,236125,0.0711115966636724
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease     DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- na¿ve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.

"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented. This proposal is also the start of a three-way collaboration between Stanford University, the University College of London (UCL), and Oxford University.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs).

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9851830,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2020,110387,0.09228924007611268
"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10049219,R01AI148470,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomass', 'ChIP-seq', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fermentation', 'Frustration', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Industry', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photosynthesis', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Shapes', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Yeasts', 'design', 'driving force', 'droplet sequencing', 'emerging antibiotic resistance', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2020,391250,0.02539036959228686
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10013198,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2020,187049,0.10367697998746431
"Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious public health threats facing society. Significantly, the vast majority of acquired AMR genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which include plasmids, insertion sequences, and transposons. One of the most important hospital and community-associated pathogens harboring resistance genes is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes more than 80,000 infections and 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. S. aureus readily acquire MGEs, which encompass more than 20% of the genome for most strains, and these elements have been central to the establishment and broad spread of resistance to antibiotics such as oxacillin and vancomycin. Additionally, S. aureus is capable of causing a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, with a mortality rate up to 30%. Utilizing an unparalleled collection of S. aureus strains from a cohort of patients in Central and South America with bacteremia, I seek to develop a framework for the identification and comparison of circulating MGEs through the use of bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning. This dataset will serve as the foundation for my training to become an independent scientist. To begin interrogating this exceptional strain collection, we have generated Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing data on 1,087 S. aureus bacteremia isolates to identify MGEs, and will leverage novel ultra-long read sequencing methodologies to fully characterize the position and variations of these elements. The three aims within this proposal are designed to elucidate the role of MGEs in driving the genetic diversification of endemic S. aureus clades, and identify if they serve as adaptation hotspots when put under selective pressure from the host immune system or antibiotics. First, I will characterize the repertoire of MGEs within this large cohort of isolates and apply gene-order and Bayesian time-measured phylogenetics to identify the predominant MGEs within each clade and how frequently they are acquired and lost. Second, I will assess the MGE diversity within isolates collected serially from the same individual. I hypothesize these MGEs will be the primary variation points and will be more important than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the adaptation to selective pressures such as antibiotics. Third, I will identify the clinical (age, BMI, and present comorbidities) and genomic (SNPs, MGEs, and genes) features that are predictive of the 30-day mortality in the predominant clades of S. aureus within our dataset. I theorize these genetic and clinical signatures will be different for each clade as they possess different repertoires of MGEs. The Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics in The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston has a firm commitment to understanding and reducing AMR and AMR infections. This provides an exceptional environment to conduct my research elucidating the role of MGEs in the clinical outcomes of S. aureus bacteremia, and to develop as an investigator and participate in the training offered to make the transition to independence. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats facing our society. This proposal aims to clarify the role mobile genetic elements play in transmitting antimicrobial resistance and driving genetic diversity within endemic Staphylococcus aureus lineages causing bacteremia. Additionally, this research will provide the platform for the career development of a young scientist focused on bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning methods to tackle the dire consequences of AMR.",Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia,10055522,K01AI148593,"['Age', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bypass', 'Carbon', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Central America', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocarditis', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxacillin', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Societies', 'Soft Tissue Infections', 'South America', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Nations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic signature', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial genomics', 'mortality', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2020,129870,0.06496878697966718
"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10034036,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,645818,-0.021269581437488562
"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus on dried blood spot samples.",NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume,10050866,R01HD099250,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral resistance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital herpes simplex', 'Consumption', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simplexvirus', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital cytomegalovirus', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal infection', 'neonate', 'next generation sequencing', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'screening program', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'viral detection']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,671761,0.0698025867769146
"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear. Our aim is to exploit the rich and versatile experimental data, integrating inhibitor potency and crystallographic structures with ensemble dynamics in an internally consistent manner using machine learning to elucidate both the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and generate predictive models of inhibitor potency.

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9997854,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'driver mutation', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2020,250795,0.06750953120346567
"Antibodies as Drugs ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Antibodies as Drugs organized by Drs. Pierre Bruhns, Patrick C. Wilson, Esther Breij and David P. Humphreys. The conference will be held in Whistler, British Columbia from January 27-30, 2021. Therapeutic antibodies continue to largely populate the list of top biologic drugs. They revolutionize the treatment of pathologies falling into major disease areas, which include cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. As more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, there has also been a concomitant increase in the frequency of resistance and escape mechanisms. Thus, researchers are exploring alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, not only are new methodological and technological advances being developed, paradigm-shifting concepts are being developed in order to face these challenges. This conference in the Keystone Symposia series on Antibodies as Drugs aims to present the state-of-the-art in antibody therapeutics, repertoires and deep learning, bispecific antibodies and engineering. This conference will provide a forum for extensive interactions between investigators from both industry and academia. Goals of this conference include discussion of recent breakthroughs in identifying therapeutics from patients, understanding vaccination and mode of delivery, modalities for half-life extensions and involvement of complement in antibody mode of action. It is anticipated that research in the field will showcase the rise of bispecific antibodies and highlight the technologies to develop them, improve their functionalities, and boost clinical efficacies, particularly in immune-oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The success of early antibody approaches has been tremendous and now they have revolutionized treatment for many major disease areas, such as cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. However, as more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, then more resistance and escape mechanisms are being found, forcing scientists to search for alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, this conference will gather scientists from many different disciplines, including structural and cellular immunology, biology, engineering, chemistry and medicine, to share ideas and help develop novel antibody therapeutics.",Antibodies as Drugs,10071067,R13AI154980,"['Academia', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bispecific Antibodies', 'British Columbia', 'Cellular Immunology', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunooncology', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Extension', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccination', 'antibody engineering', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'posters', 'prevent', 'resistance frequency', 'success', 'symposium']",NIAID,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2020,11500,0.03388221176396322
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses.

"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous models grossly overestimated the MDR risk and exacerbated the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance and excess mortality. The overall goal of this proposed K08 research is to identify common sepsis phenotypes that will enable better prescribing practices and standardized comparisons across hospitals, which will help practicing clinicians, researchers, healthcare institutions, and policy makers. These themes correlate with NIGMS's interest in finding innovative methods and leveraging big data to improve sepsis outcomes. Our three specific aims reflect these goals: (1) establish resistance thresholds for MDR Gram- negative bacilli (GNB) that cause sepsis, (2) assess the impact of sepsis definition on the performance of risk prediction models for MDR GNB, and (3) identify sepsis phenotypes at high risk for MDR GNB in a well-balanced cohort and assess the impact of case mix on risk prediction model performance. We will mathematically derive resistance thresholds that link population resistance rates to individual patient risk of death in sepsis caused by MDR GNB, assess factors that impact prediction performance, and incorporate rich clinical data from 15 hospitals in our healthcare system to identify stable common sepsis phenotypes. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients. This proposal will build on her clinical work and previous research experience in finding innovative methods to solve challenging problems at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care medicine. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has six career objectives: (1) pursue advanced training in clinical epidemiology; (2) acquire skills in advanced linear regression and multilevel modeling; (3) learn supervised machine learning methods; (4) acquire skills in big data management in healthcare and methods to handle missing data; (5) improve scientific communication, grantsmanship, and leadership, and (6) participate in training in the responsible conduct of research. She will achieve these goals through didactic coursework, hands-on research experience, and active mentoring from experts in Infectious Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and applied clinical informatics. She will continue to develop innovative methods to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially in critically ill patients, and become an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis, the experienced mentorship team, and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in antimicrobial resistance and sepsis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The significant burden of sepsis augmented by the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance has incited many national performance improvement initiatives. Research efforts have focused on predicting patients at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens but existing models have led to risk overestimation thus promoting indiscriminate antimicrobial use and further fueling the emergence of resistance. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has focused on innovative ways to assess the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to develop generalizable useful risk prediction models. The current proposed research expands her previous work with the overall goal to develop clinical decision support tools that will improve antibiotic prescribing practices and will allow valid, case-mix adjusted comparisons across hospitals in terms of resistance prevalence rates and antimicrobial use.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10106044,K08GM140310,"['American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacillus', 'Big Data', 'Case Mixes', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Empiricism', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'big data management', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'combat', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,167942,0.10128779504954072
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,10015205,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2020,885000,0.06460570647046154
"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them.

"Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. We propose to build an open-source scalable generalizable method that would assist experimentalists and clinicians on assessing patient's risk of developing therapy resistance and would establish a foundation for our long-term goal to build a platform for patient-centric clinical decision making, personalized therapeutic advice, and disease management.  We propose to develop a generalizable versatile bioinformatics paradigm that will use patient molecular profiles to PREDICT their Therapy Response, PREDICTTR, which combines network analysis, statistical modeling, and ensemble machine learning in a unique innovative way that allows accurate elucidation of complex multi-level relationships that govern treatment response. The objective of our proposed approach is two-fold: (i) uncover molecular markers and valuable candidates for therapeutic intervention, which can potentially be targeted to preclude or overcome resistance; and (ii) predict patient's response to therapy administration, which holds a long-term promise to improve disease outcome and reduce the cost of unnecessary and ineffective treatments.  Motivated by increasing cases of treatment resistance in oncology, we will apply our algorithm to elucidate (i) response to androgen targeting in prostate cancer and (ii) response to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. We will disseminate our approach through a web-based decision- making tool, which will be implemented through a Hadoop-oriented solution to (i) broaden its practical impact and (ii) establish clinical utility. Taken together, this multi-task resource is a unique innovative effort of its kind in the therapeutic resistance space with a direct broad impact on personalized therapeutic advice and disease management. Even though we will train our model in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, our approach can be easily and broadly applicable to other therapies and diseases.  This effort will be led by an Early Stage Investigator, Antonina Mitrofanova (PI) who has extensive training and expertise in biomedical informatics and big data analytics. Her collaborative team includes Dr. Shantenu Jha (Rutgers, co-I) who is an expert in distributed systems and will advise on Hadoop development and validation; Dr. Shridar Ganesan (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide clinical and sequencing patient data and incorporate the utilization of our method into the Rutgers CINJ Molecular Tumor Board; Dr. Isaac Kim (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide additional data for validation in prostate cancer; Dr. Christopher Hourigan (NHLBI , NIH, Significant Collaborator), who will provide data for clinical validation in acute myeloid leukemia and is committed to test our web-based portal; and Dr. Scott Parrott (Rutgers, co-I), who is an expert in statistical analysis and will consult on power calculations and multiple testing corrections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. This proposal is dedicated to developing novel biomedical informatics paradigm to uncover genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and predict patients at risk of treatment failure, which will be shared with a wide scientific community through an open-source web-based portal. We utilize resistance to androgen-deprivation and second- generation anti-androgens in prostate cancer and resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia as our training examples, yet our paradigm can be broadly generalizable to study resistance to various therapeutic regimens and across different diseases.",Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response,10117702,R01LM013236,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Androgen Antagonists', 'Androgens', 'Atlases', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Institute of New Jersey', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distributed Systems', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oncology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'androgen deprivation therapy', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genome', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'multitask', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'standard of care', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapy development', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'unnecessary treatment', 'web portal']",NLM,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R01,2020,323986,0.03121271268219653
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram Project Summary/Abstract Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million people and are associated with at least 35,900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularly problematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-line antimicrobials have emerged globally, while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled. To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens, it is essential to guide clinicians away from choosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram, a facility-level summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data, is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empiric therapy. However, antibiograms have major limitations. First, little is known about how clinicians are currently using them when making empiric therapy decision. Second, antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-level, and data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly, but most importantly, an antibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore, there are strong, and pressing needs to understand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician, 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk of AMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapy and reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel, real-time personalized antibiogram (“Smart Antibiogram”) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapy for GNRs by providing a “predicted risk of AMR” based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- and facility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informatics coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinical practice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions for Gram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assess the accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a large retrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict the individualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally. This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (“Smart Antibiogram”). The expected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of antibiogram, and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08 Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR and health informatics, with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public health threats in the United States and globally. By using series of survey of clinicians, retrospective cohort analyses, and machine learning prediction analytics, this study elucidates the current perceptions for AMR among providers and creates a machine learning model to accurately predict AMR risk at patient-level. The findings from this study will help create a decision-support system to guide clinicians for appropriate empiric therapy to treat infections due to Gram-negative rod organisms and prepare the applicant for a career as an independent infectious diseases health service investigator.",Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram,10124644,K08HS027472,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2020,144640,0.043323300843223625
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10048017,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2020,103817,0.038765191381281906
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9922844,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,1755886,0.1896278337006458
