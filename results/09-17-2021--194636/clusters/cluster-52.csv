"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes. Proper patient self-management is perhaps the most critical and under-exercised element for patients to achieve appropriate glycemic control and thus mitigate complications and comorbid conditions, and implement appropriate preventive strategies (e.g., vaccines, exercise, healthy diet). In previous work we have shown that educating patients by using content in their medical records improved diabetes outcomes and that NoteAid, a multi- module natural language processing system that links medical jargon in electronic health records to definitions, has improved self-reported comprehension. Here we propose to develop NoteAid with a high-quality resource of expert-curated lay definitions and evaluation methods for diabetes patients’ note comprehension. ! !

"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,0.01875626335832272
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,0.02680590516000937
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases. It is anticipated that the data resources, algorithms, and the Anticoagulant Pharmacovigilance Toolkit (APVTK) developed will significantly enhance ADE detection, patient surveillance and post marketing pharmacovigilance.",EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance,9628032,R01HL125089,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcomes Research', 'Package Insert', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'data resource', 'disorder prevention', 'dosage', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'pharmacovigilance', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,809552,0.01609048811977446
"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,9641903,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'oncology', 'rosiglitazone', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,347250,-0.0044890741529655075
"Exploring the evolving relationship between tobacco, marijuana and e-cigarettes Abstract The relationship between marijuana, tobacco, and e-cigarettes is both rapidly changing and poorly understood, particularly in the light of recent federal and state-level regulatory changes governing the availability of e- cigarettes and marijuana products (respectively).

"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,9738559,R01HS026246,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,397831,0.024960646072150056
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9652537,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tweens', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2019,76250,0.01621138800080825
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team.

"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9756410,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,233078,0.010959781814428872
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable.

"Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly  detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports     Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. Numerous healthcare providers have adopted these systems, which provide a framework for healthcare provlder staff to report patient safety events. Public databases like MAUDE and VAERS have also been created to collect and trend safety events across healthcare systems. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter ls not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely descrlbe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) ldentifylng document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. An important advantage of our research team is the involvement of healthcare domain experts and access to frontline staff, and we will leverage this strength to develop our algorithms. A key feature of our work is the generalizability of our methods, which will be applicable to biomedical documents arising across a remarkable variety of areas, such as patient safety and equipment malfunction reports, electronic health records, adverse drug or vaccine reports, etc. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, despite the frequently cited Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that first brought attention to the problem over ten years ago. Identifying temporal trends and patterns in the data is particularly important to improving patient safety and patient care. Using our algorithms to effectively analyze documents from reporting systems has the potential to dramatically improve the safety and quality of care by exposing possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly  detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports    ,9914443,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Report (document)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'hazard', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'spatiotemporal', 'trend']",NLM,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,279001,0.05483687825342223
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others.

"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9739347,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2019,168188,-0.00032947666261981203

We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9731456,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,399999,0.06751224753666663
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,0.007758659275902263

"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,0.01875626335832272
"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,9577760,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'therapy development']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,402500,0.018721060593737144
"Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance PROJECT SUMMARY The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Quality Payment Program is designed to motivate healthcare providers to adhere to best practices in clinical healthcare and patient safety. Unfortunately, extracting quality measures data from the clinical record is burdensome and as such, participation among clinical healthcare providers is suboptimal. Our aim is to develop a system to facilitate automatic extraction of quality data. This will reduce the burden of data collection and help remove the barrier to participation that keeps more providers from participating in the program. The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. We envision this to be an effective research partnership that leverages the complementary assets of SaferMD, a small business unit, and the University of Michigan, a non-profit research institution, to develop and evaluate a prototype tool to extract clinical quality measures data, and increase participation in the Quality Payment Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. The project will develop algorithms to identify fields relevant for quality measures and develop tools to extract and analyze these data elements from large sets of radiology reports. Finally, the proposed work will initiate the extracted measures into existing quality service offerings by SaferMD.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR).

In order to understand this changing landscape we need new, ﬂexible, and responsive research methods capable of rapidly providing insights into product initiation patterns, use patterns, and cessation strategies. Social media — here deﬁned as including internet discussion forums — provides a ready-made source of abundant, naturalistic, longitudinal, publicly accessible, ﬁrst-person narratives with which to understand health behaviours and attitudes. We propose to use a combination of qualitative methods and automated natural language processing techniques to investigate online discussion forums devoted to tobacco, marijuana, and e-cigarettes in order to understand user trajectories through the three product categories.

"Evaluating the Impact of Changes in Opioid Prescribing Across Health Systems Implementing Zero Suicide This timely supplement would support our goals for the current award: An Evaluation of the National Zero Suicide Model Across Learning Healthcare Systems (U01MH114087) by capitalizing on a natural experiment, the planned the national roll-out of safety planning templates in behavioral health departments across five Kaiser Permanente regions and Henry Ford Health System in 2019. Safety planning is a highly recommended practice within the Zero Suicide (ZS) framework, but little is known about the effectiveness of the individual elements that can make up a safety plan, such as lethal means assessment, identification of supportive contacts, coping skills, warning signs, and sources of distraction. The current Zero Suicide award proposes to examine the impact of safety planning and lethal means assessment using a stepped-wedged interrupted time- series (ITS) approach, measuring each as a binary variable (e.g. safety planning did or did not occur). The ITS approach requires that some sites implement safety planning (intervention sites for safety planning), while others do not (control sites for safety planning). The proposed ITS approach is now problematic without further work for two reasons: 1) All Kaiser Permanente sites and Henry Ford have decided to uniformly implement safety planning around the same time, therefore there are no control sites 2) Without control sites, metrics that can accurately measure variation in safety planning/lethal means assessment at baseline and then longitudinally thereafter would enable our evaluation to take place, but all of the documentation lives in text- based clinical narratives. In working with our health system leads on the development of Zero Suicide metrics, we have been informed that the rate for safety planning and lethal means assessment at baseline is not zero, but the actual rate is unknown. This supplement will support development of new metrics using Natural Language Processing to determine baseline rates, from which, we can quantify the change in safety planning and lethal means assessment practice longitudinally after implementation of new safety planning templates using our Zero Suicide main award. Furthermore, we propose to take advantage of the newly implemented templates to address an important mediator of the effect of safety planning on suicide outcomes, the impact of fidelity to the new templates, which we define as quality, completeness, and level of integration with ongoing care. We propose the following three specific aims for this supplemental work: 1) Identify key terms for safety planning and lethal means assessment 1.) Develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics to assess the occurrence of safety planning and lethal means assessment at three Zero Suicide sites 2) Implement NLP queries for identification of safety planning and lethal means assessment and measure baseline rates 3) Upon implementation of electronic safety planning templates in medical records, develop and implement metrics using NLP for assessing fidelity (completeness, quality, integration with care) to safety planning templates. Project Narrative: This supplement to the current award: An Evaluation of the National Zero Suicide Model Across Learning Healthcare Systems (U01MH114087) will take advantage of a national roll-out for safety planning templates in the electronic medical record across 5 Kaiser Permanente regions and Henry Ford Health System. It will support the development of innovative measures using natural language processing to efficiently quantify the baseline rates of safety planning and lethal means assessment across multiple sites, which will enable a rigorous evaluation to take place upon implementation of the new electronic templates. Furthermore, we propose to take advantage of the safety planning template roll-out by measuring fidelity (quality, completeness, and level of integration with care), because it may be an important mediator of the relationship between safety planning and suicide outcomes.",Evaluating the Impact of Changes in Opioid Prescribing Across Health Systems Implementing Zero Suicide,9676620,U01MH114087,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorado', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coping Skills', 'Country', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Firearms', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral outcome', 'design', 'distraction', 'health plan', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'prescription opioid', 'reducing suicide', 'safety practice', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicide model', 'tool']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,U01,2018,262124,0.021470689251894885
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030.

"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser.

"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable.

"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9534182,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient-clinician communication', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,335217,-0.0015952459714744607
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9566983,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,187483,0.015621951240646277
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9520862,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2018,201825,-0.00032947666261981203
"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9447854,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,400000,0.06751224753666663
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,9567932,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,249135,0.05271677140013369
"Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Title: Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Project Summary/Abstract Population level studies have shown that the device-based hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with increased risks of reoperation during follow-up, when compared to traditional laparoscopic sterilization. However, secondary data sources often lack the granularity to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to the device removal and additional surgery. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports submitted to the FDA by mandatory and voluntary reporters. These reports contain detailed information of patient and device adverse events. But due to its narrative structure, research with the reports has been limited, partially due to the restrictions of keyword search and manual review. The proposed study will innovatively apply natural language processing (NLP) to analyze MAUDE reports of device removals. NLP is a powerful tool capable of extracting information efficiently from documents such as medical notes, allowing the summarization of thousands of adverse event reports in a cost-effective way. The primary aim is to develop an NLP program to extract and summarize patient- and device-specific complications associated with device removal and additional surgeries following hysteroscopic sterilization. Secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting behavior and structure. The hypotheses are that the majority of reported removals were associated with device-related complications as opposed to persistent symptoms only, and that after the FDA convened a panel discussion in September 2015, adverse event reports were more likely to be submitted by mandatory reporters, with improvement in structured presentation. Adverse event reports related to device removal will be selected from the MAUDE database using keyword search first, and 1,000 reports will be annotated and used to develop and validate the NLP tool. Applying the developed NLP to all reports, extracted information will be used for the analysis, and comparisons will be made before and after September 2015. The significance of the proposed research is that it will develop a method to better utilize adverse event reports to obtain crucial device safety information supplemental to regular population-level studies. By achieving this, the long term goal is to create a useful tool for future medical device safety surveillance to understand the nature of adverse events. The immediate next step will be to use the tool to investigate device safety in other areas. The comprehension of the nature of device adverse events and the elucidation of the crucial role of regulatory activity in facilitating reliable adverse event reporting will help promote patient safety evaluation and monitoring. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on device adverse event reports and develop a powerful tool to analyze reports to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to device removals and additional surgeries. The study will also elucidate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting.

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9254614,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,377260,0.007758659275902263
"From genomics to natural language processing: A protected environment for research computing in the health science NIH S10 equipment proposal: From genomics to natural language processing:  A protected environment for research computing in the health sciences. Health sciences researchers are often required to manage, mine, and analyze restricted patient data (Protected Health Information, PHI) to facilitate and advance their research aims. They are often required to do this without access to central information technology expertise or resources to facilitate their research aims. These researchers are often left to their own devices to “solve” their research compute and data needs and are challenged due to lack of available resources, barriers from central IT, and/or lack of knowledge of available resources. A further challenge is that “small” data sets— data that researchers could formerly handle on office resources—have morphed and grown into the big data domain through the explosion of technical advances and significant expansion in various research directions. Examples include: genomics research, image analysis, simulation, natural language processing, and mining of EMRs. Therefore, the need exists to develop a framework for managing and processing this data securely and reliably. This S10 equipment proposal is to replace the “protected environment” (PE) prototype the University of Utah’s Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and Department of Biomedical Informatics built six years ago and has operated since. The PE consists of both high performance computing and virtual machine (VM) components and associated storage sufficient to manage, protect and analyze HIPAA protected health information. This environment has been very successful and has grown significantly in scope. CHPC isolated this protected environment in the secured University of Utah Downtown Data Center and setup a network protected logical partition that provided research groups specific access to individual data sets. As the environment and technology developed, CHPC added additional security features such as two-factor authentication for entry and audit/monitoring. Unfortunately, the prototype has reached the point where demand is surpassing capability and all the hardware is aged and off-warranty. To give an idea of users of the virtual machine farm component, the Biomedical Informatics Core (BMIC) REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) environment for data collection has over 2,500 users in 1,500 projects supporting over $25M in NIH funding at the University of Utah, including support for more than 25 active NIH R-01 grants. Moreover, the HIPAA compliant protected environment was a key factor that aided passing the recent University of Utah HIPAA audit. The “protected environment” also helped the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and the BMIC justify the NCATS Center Clinical and Translational Science award (1ULTR001067). NIH S10 equipment proposal: From genomics to natural language processing:  A protected environment for research computing in the health sciences. Project Narrative: The proposed “Protected Environment” instrument will provide research computing and data management capabilities for health sciences researchers to properly manage, secure, and analyze HIPAA regulated protected health information.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9254613,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2017,248999,0.0030996386283628453
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings.

"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9332464,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,335217,-0.0015952459714744607
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.015621951240646277
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,9278303,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'novel therapeutics', 'population health', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2017,176472,0.03994128459340552
"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.  We believe this application aligns with AHRQ's HIT and Patient Safety portfolios as well as AHRQ's Special Emphasis Notice to support projects to generate new evidence on health IT system safety (NOT- HS-15-005).

"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9342692,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,148922,-0.02343295703710484
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,9352770,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,249135,0.05271677140013369
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9228509,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'database structure', 'design', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2016,249000,0.0030996386283628453
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9115724,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,335217,-0.0015952459714744607
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,9109047,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'ethnic difference', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,430717,0.029274851250707085
"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potentials, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potentials for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of the research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data, and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious ad costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically de-identify clinical notes found in the EHR, to then improve the availability of clinical text for secondary uses, as well as ameliorate the protection of patient data confidentiality. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the text de-identification application, a reference standard that will include a random sample of clinical narratives with protected health information annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically de-identify clinical text in near real-time, a prototype that will implement a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first (our priority for de-identification), and then filter out false positives to enhance positive predictive value, and also replace PHI with realistic substitutes for improved protection; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing, and also train and test the prototype with a reference standard from another healthcare organization. Commercial application: To strengthen patient information confidentiality protection, the HITECH Act heightened financial penalties incurred for breaches of PHI, even introducing criminal penalties. These new severe consequences for violation of patient information confidentiality render protection requirements even more obvious, and automatic high-accuracy clinical text de-identification, as offered by the system Clinacuity proposes, will strongly help healthcare and clinical research organizations avoid such consequences. This system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will also ease research data sharing, and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The adoption of Electronic Health Record systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical daa becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potentials, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfil the potentials for high quality healthcare and effective clinical research. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data, and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes that have been dictated and transcribed or directly typed in, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious and costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for much faster de-identification than manual approaches. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new system to automatically de-identify clinical narrative text in he Electronic Health Record, to then improve the availability of clinical text for secondary uses, as well as ameliorate the protection of patient data confidentiality.",Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing,8982010,R41GM116479,"['Abbreviations', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Direct Costs', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Eponyms', 'Gilbert Disease', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Informed Consent', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Data Privacy', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Privacy', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'common rule', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'patient privacy', 'payment', 'prototype', 'statistics', 'text searching']",NIGMS,"CLINACUITY,INC.",R41,2016,223924,-0.019276389100289535

"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,9069515,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'novel therapeutics', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2016,176472,0.03994128459340552
"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.  We believe this application aligns with AHRQ's HIT and Patient Safety portfolios as well as AHRQ's Special Emphasis Notice to support projects to generate new evidence on health IT system safety (NOT- HS-15-005). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public Health Relevance Statement  Errors in medical documents are dangerous for patients. Physician use of speech recognition technology, a computerized form of medical transcription, has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency.

The goal of this study is two-fold: 1) to study the nature of such errors and how they may affect the quality of care and 2) to develop innovative methods based on computerized natural language processing to automatically detect these errors in clinical documents so that physicians can correct the documents before entering them into the patient's medical record.",NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents,9146893,R01HS024264,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,249994,-0.02311424177778789
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9245525,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2016,148922,-0.02343295703710484
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety.

"EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in substantial patient morbidity and lead to over 100,000 deaths yearly. The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cancer drugs is an important, unsolved problem.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.

Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the science of human factors and data analytics to improve the usability and safety of health information technology and ultimately improve patient care.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8875053,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,531035,0.02276147124925499
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8911361,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,325159,-0.0015952459714744607
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8882546,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,417794,0.029274851250707085
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8857265,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2015,176472,0.03994128459340552
"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.

The goal of this study is two-fold: 1) to study the nature of such errors and how they may affect the quality of care and 2) to develop innovative methods based on computerized natural language processing to automatically detect these errors in clinical documents so that physicians can correct the documents before entering them into the patient's medical record.            ",NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents,9004939,R01HS024264,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,250000,-0.02311424177778789
"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8928601,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,139245,-0.002678447536964901
"Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will create, test, implement, and evaluate a real-time Adverse Drug Effect (ADE) alerting system at Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH). Utilizing information extracted from admission history and physical examination notes (H&Ps) stored in the electronic medical record (EMR), our system will detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. The project will create an ADE knowledge base, mined from multiple publically available sources including MEDLINE, RxNorm, and the product labels for human prescription drugs. Next, we will apply natural language processing (NLP) to EMR-based H&P texts to identify mentions of patients' current medications and dosages. We will similarly detect EMR-based H&P documentation of patients' clinical manifestations (CMs - diseases, symptoms, findings, etc.), and then represent them using the Unified Medical Language System's (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). The system will then compare each patient's recognized medications and CMs against the aforementioned ADE knowledgebase, generating appropriate patient-specific alerts for potential adverse effects related to the patient's current medications. Each alert will identify the offendin medication, the suspected nature of the ADE, and evidence supporting the assertion. We will independently evaluate the accuracy of the ADE knowledgebase using expert manual review and comparison to multiple other sources. Before implementing the real-time ADE monitoring system, we will conduct a pilot implementation using retrospective EMR data from the Vanderbilt Synthetic Derivative (SD), a de-identified version of the Vanderbilt EMR. After successful testing and any necessary iterative improvements, we will implement the real-time detection system at VUH, initially monitoring newly admitted inpatients presenting to the Internal Medicine service. Using the methods described above, the system will detect potential ADEs each time a new inpatient H&P is generated, and alert appropriate clinicians via additions to an existing dashboard that the clinicians already utilize. We will survey clinicians immediately upon receipt of an ADE alert to determine if the alerting condition was already known or not, whether the alert seems plausible, and whether it requires intervention. Then we will compare discharge medications to admission medications to determine what actions occurred post-alert, independent of physician survey results. We will thus evaluate both the effectiveness of the system in improving ADE recognition and its perceived usefulness according to the physician-subjects. We hypothesize that our system will improve clinicians' awareness of ADEs in a manner applicable to any facility that stores admission H&Ps electronically. Addressing previously unrecognized ADEs has the potential to reduce costs and improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized adverse drug effects (ADEs), a serious clinical problem, cause preventable hospitalizations, increase healthcare costs, and worsen health outcomes. To potentially improve quality of care, my dissertation project will develop and evaluate a novel system to detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. Using automated natural language processing of clinician-generated electronic admission history and physical exam (H&P) notes and a locally-developed ADE knowledgebase derived from publically available sources, the system, once validated, could improve both recognition and treatment of ADEs in a generalizable manner - applicable in hospital environments using electronic medical records.            ",Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes,8796404,R36HS023485,[' '],AHRQ,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R36,2015,41626,0.015452147711791054
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,8928596,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,249655,0.05271677140013369
"EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in substantial patient morbidity and lead to over 100,000 deaths yearly. The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cancer drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Medical Record (EMR), discharge summaries, and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" BioNLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EMRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to automatically extract adverse drug event from the Electronic Medical Record.

Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems. The research has public health at its core.",Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance,8894203,R00LM011393,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Broadcast Media', 'Cities', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Earthquakes', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'center for epidemiological studies depression scale', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'depressive symptoms', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'social', 'syndromic surveillance', 'text searching', 'tool', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R00,2014,224100,-0.01644760437580715
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8722624,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,300537,0.03142938978315326
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8708209,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,535841,0.02276147124925499
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported.                 Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8760594,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,398307,-0.0015952459714744607
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8660067,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,417795,0.029274851250707085
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8711562,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,176472,0.03994128459340552
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.

"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.            ","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8805997,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,154347,-0.002678447536964901
"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments.

"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.            ",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,8818528,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,249655,0.05271677140013369
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work.              Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"EHR-based patient safety: Automated error detection in neonatal intensive care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of neonatal patient safety, the paucity of systematic research is a critical barrier to progress. Notably missing are studies that meticulously investigate Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information technology in detecting neonatal intensive care-related errors. The expert panel at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) identified multiple gaps in the current knowledge of neonatal patient safety research. The proposed work is a well focused response to three dimensions of the Funding Opportunity Announcement:  1.Develop prospective and retrospective study designs to collect data on patient safety and adverse events.  2.Study the strength and limitations of current methods of error reporting systems.  3.Study the usefulness of commercial IT systems and EHRs in reducing medical errors.  In our study we seek to shift patient safety research toward an automated and computerized approach to achieve a more comprehensive patient safety paradigm. We will develop novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) content-based automated algorithms that are new to patient safety research to 1) detect errors (Aim 1) and 2) categorize subsequent harm (Aim 2). State of the art information extraction and statistical classification techniques from the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be adapted to the patient safety research tasks.  In Aim 1 we will fill the gap in the literatre by implementing a focused manual review of 700 charts (one full year of patient admissions at our institution) in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the nation. Using a trigger tool, we will identify errors occurring in three specified categories - laboratory test errrs, medication/fluid errors, and airway management errors. We will develop novel algorithms for automated EHR-based detection of the errors and evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against the performance of both trigger tool review by human chart reviewers (current gold standard) and the voluntary incident reporting system (accepted standard). In Aim 2, we will study the utility of novel EHR-based information extraction and statistical algorithms for the automated categorization of errors according to the resulting level of harm.  Our proposed work has the potential to accomplish a paradigm shift in the methods of neonatal patient safety research and practice. The study is a fundamental step to automating patient safety monitoring on a large scale and improving error identification and patient safety in NICUs for millions of children every year.          We are developing an automated error detection technique to improve the safety of newborn babies during hospital care. Our work is the first known attempt to use text analysis in the electronic health records on a large scale to reduce the cost while at the same time increase the speed and comprehensiveness of error detection in the clinical care of newborns.

"Text Processing and Geospatial Uncertainty for Phylogeography of Zoonotic Viruses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phylogeography of zoonotic viruses studies the geographical spread and genetic lineages of viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans such as avian influenza and rabies. This science can help state public health and agriculture agencies identify the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of the virus including its origin, and the patterns of infection in various host populations, including humans, over time. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), specifically GenBank, provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. However, geospatial metadata such as host location is inconsistently represented and sparse across GenBank entries, with our preliminary studies showing only about 20% of the GenBank records contain specific information such as a county, town, or region within a state. While this detailed geospatial information might be included in the corresponding journal article, it is not available for immediate use in a bioinformatics or GIS application unless it is manually extracted and linked back to the appropriate sequence. Absence of precise sampling locations from easily-computable secondary data sources such as GenBank increases the difficulty of achieving accurate phylogeographic models of virus migration. We propose an infrastructure to improve phylogeographic models of virus migration by linking relevant geospatial data from the literature. This work represents the first effort to use automatically extracted geospatial data present in journal articles corresponding to GenBank records in order to enhance modeling of virus migration. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the data extracted in Aim 1 with adequate biostatistical models (Aim 2), and evaluating the impact of our approach for phylogeography and surveillance of zoonotic viruses (Aim 3). Thus, this work will provide researchers with a framework for population surveillance using an integrated biomedical informatics approach including NLP, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and database design.           We will create Natural Language Processing Infrastructure and novel phylogeographic models of zoonotic viruses that will allow state public health and agriculture agencies and other researchers to study virus migration. This will enhance population health surveillance including identification of the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of zoonotic pathogens, and the patterns of infection in various host populations over time, including humans.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8578484,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,590023,0.02276147124925499
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8438732,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,440117,0.029274851250707085
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.                ",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8581368,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2013,176472,0.03994128459340552
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology.

"Integration of an NLP-based application to support medication management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. Stage 1 of Meaningful Use requires certified EHRs to be capable of providing a user with the ability to perform medication reconciliation. However, most previous studies have taken place in the inpatient setting, while medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting is importnt and challenging. In addition, clinical notes contain critical medication information that also need to be reconciled. Our goal of this study is to develop novel methods and a system using natural language processing (NLP) and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process in the ambulatory setting. Our specific aims are to : 1) identify the requirements, use cases, work flow issues, barriers to and facilitators of using clinical notes and a NLP-based system in the medication reconciliation process; 2) design a generic system architecture and an application that integrates an NLP system and a web-based user interface within an existing medication reconciliation system; 3) pilot this study in two primary care clinics and measure the utilization, usability, performance and feasibility of the proposed methods and the tool; and 4) distribute our methods and the tool and to make them widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.          An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. In thi study, we will develop novel methods and a tool using natural language processing and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process.

"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and it is output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented.

Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",8318253,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2012,327503,0.05030729930889404
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"EHR-based patient safety: Automated error detection in neonatal intensive care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of neonatal patient safety, the paucity of systematic research is a critical barrier to progress. Notably missing are studies that meticulously investigate Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information technology in detecting neonatal intensive care-related errors. The expert panel at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) identified multiple gaps in the current knowledge of neonatal patient safety research. The proposed work is a well focused response to three dimensions of the Funding Opportunity Announcement:  1.Develop prospective and retrospective study designs to collect data on patient safety and adverse events.  2.Study the strength and limitations of current methods of error reporting systems.  3.Study the usefulness of commercial IT systems and EHRs in reducing medical errors.  In our study we seek to shift patient safety research toward an automated and computerized approach to achieve a more comprehensive patient safety paradigm. We will develop novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) content-based automated algorithms that are new to patient safety research to 1) detect errors (Aim 1) and 2) categorize subsequent harm (Aim 2). State of the art information extraction and statistical classification techniques from the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be adapted to the patient safety research tasks.  In Aim 1 we will fill the gap in the literatre by implementing a focused manual review of 700 charts (one full year of patient admissions at our institution) in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the nation. Using a trigger tool, we will identify errors occurring in three specified categories - laboratory test errrs, medication/fluid errors, and airway management errors. We will develop novel algorithms for automated EHR-based detection of the errors and evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against the performance of both trigger tool review by human chart reviewers (current gold standard) and the voluntary incident reporting system (accepted standard). In Aim 2, we will study the utility of novel EHR-based information extraction and statistical algorithms for the automated categorization of errors according to the resulting level of harm.  Our proposed work has the potential to accomplish a paradigm shift in the methods of neonatal patient safety research and practice.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying  factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal  treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological  research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public  records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained.  Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at  hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data  source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the  wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical  information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that  information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as  selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical  methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for  observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing  EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient  manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will  contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based  information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information  from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to  analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the  standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the  capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost.   The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to  extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and  use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both case-  control and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon  cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two  major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our  study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Project Narrative  According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various  types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.       RELEVANCE (See instrucfions): To advance personalized medicine-treatment and preventive care based on individual traits; this project matches small differences in DNA to infectious disease susceptibility and response to statins, serotonin- specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and blood pressure medications.

"Integration of an NLP-based application to support medication management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. Stage 1 of Meaningful Use requires certified EHRs to be capable of providing a user with the ability to perform medication reconciliation. However, most previous studies have taken place in the inpatient setting, while medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting is importnt and challenging. In addition, clinical notes contain critical medication information that also need to be reconciled. Our goal of this study is to develop novel methods and a system using natural language processing (NLP) and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process in the ambulatory setting. Our specific aims are to : 1) identify the requirements, use cases, work flow issues, barriers to and facilitators of using clinical notes and a NLP-based system in the medication reconciliation process; 2) design a generic system architecture and an application that integrates an NLP system and a web-based user interface within an existing medication reconciliation system; 3) pilot this study in two primary care clinics and measure the utilization, usability, performance and feasibility of the proposed methods and the tool; and 4) distribute our methods and the tool and to make them widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,8318797,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly woman', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2012,383445,0.022448478134037393
"Near Miss Narratives from the Fire Service: A Bayesian Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will analyze the narrative text fields in all National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (NFFNMRS) reports submitted since the system was created in 2005 (3,695 reports as of September 30, 2009). Near miss reporting systems have made major contributions to safety in such industries as aviation, nuclear power, petrochemical processing, steel production, and military operations, because the same patterns of causes of failure and their relations precede both adverse events and near misses. However, firefighters and researchers lack a scientific system to fully analyze the near miss data collected each year. This innovative effort will advance knowledge in firefighter safety by applying novel Bayesian methods of analysis to the narrative text fields of a new data source that has not yet been rigorously investigated. The proposal has 3 aims:  I. to use recently developed auto coding methods to characterize firefighter near miss narratives and classify these narratives into mechanisms of risk/injury. This analysis will apply the International Classification of External Cause of Injuries (ICECI) using Bayesian machine learning techniques to identify the various mechanisms captured in the near miss narratives and their relative prevalence.  II. To identify the correlation between each mechanism of risk/injury and each of the ""Contributing Factors"" listed on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will reveal any patterns and trends in the distribution of the contributing factors among the mechanisms, creating a deeper understanding of near miss circumstances, as well as a basis for improving the quality of future near miss data collection.  III. To use manual coding to identify actual injury incidents contained within a random sample of 1,000 near miss narratives and correlate these injuries with the ""Loss Potential"" categories on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will demonstrate how actual injuries are distributed within the reporting form's ""Loss Potential"" categories. This proposed study of the near miss narrative text in combination with coded data has the potential to reveal new insights that can strengthen firefighter safety through primary prevention. This study addresses a major gap in firefighter safety knowledge, i.e. the insufficient understanding of near miss events, and will have a high impact on efforts to improve the occupational health and safety of firefighters.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",8105502,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,333575,0.05030729930889404
"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8055880,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,328942,0.024186068710148785
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.  Project Narrative According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,8110041,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,252298,-0.009572822364745813
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.       RELEVANCE (See instrucfions): To advance personalized medicine-treatment and preventive care based on individual traits; this project matches small differences in DNA to infectious disease susceptibility and response to statins, serotonin- specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and blood pressure medications.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,8143550,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly woman', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2011,389385,0.022448478134037393

"Near Miss Narratives from the Fire Service: A Bayesian Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will analyze the narrative text fields in all National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (NFFNMRS) reports submitted since the system was created in 2005 (3,695 reports as of September 30, 2009). Near miss reporting systems have made major contributions to safety in such industries as aviation, nuclear power, petrochemical processing, steel production, and military operations, because the same patterns of causes of failure and their relations precede both adverse events and near misses. However, firefighters and researchers lack a scientific system to fully analyze the near miss data collected each year. This innovative effort will advance knowledge in firefighter safety by applying novel Bayesian methods of analysis to the narrative text fields of a new data source that has not yet been rigorously investigated. The proposal has 3 aims:  I. to use recently developed auto coding methods to characterize firefighter near miss narratives and classify these narratives into mechanisms of risk/injury. This analysis will apply the International Classification of External Cause of Injuries (ICECI) using Bayesian machine learning techniques to identify the various mechanisms captured in the near miss narratives and their relative prevalence.  II. To identify the correlation between each mechanism of risk/injury and each of the ""Contributing Factors"" listed on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will reveal any patterns and trends in the distribution of the contributing factors among the mechanisms, creating a deeper understanding of near miss circumstances, as well as a basis for improving the quality of future near miss data collection.  III. To use manual coding to identify actual injury incidents contained within a random sample of 1,000 near miss narratives and correlate these injuries with the ""Loss Potential"" categories on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will demonstrate how actual injuries are distributed within the reporting form's ""Loss Potential"" categories. This proposed study of the near miss narrative text in combination with coded data has the potential to reveal new insights that can strengthen firefighter safety through primary prevention. This study addresses a major gap in firefighter safety knowledge, i.e. the insufficient understanding of near miss events, and will have a high impact on efforts to improve the occupational health and safety of firefighters.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study will analyze the narrative text fields in all National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (NFFNMRS) reports submitted since the system was created in 2005 (3,695 reports as of September 30, 2009).

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators.

"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known. In this project we will design a system for analyzing the information about statin side effects in the electronic medical records.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",7779983,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,343397,0.05030729930889404
"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan).

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening.

Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8056227,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,177422,0.024186068710148785
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,7925776,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,259993,-0.009594173280886466
"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine.

"Voice Based, Workflow Enhancing, Primary Care Medical Data Input System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals and physician offices has been widely promoted as a single solution to a wide variety of health care issues. Yet 84% of small and medium business (SMB) physician practices in the US have not adopted EHR systems. Interventional Dynamics Corporation (IDC) has conducted more than 200 primary care physician interviews, finding that the major disincentives to adoption are workflow delay and expense. The single greatest factor in the reduction of workflow speed is the data input process. IDC's proposed project has this specific aim: Utilize an innovative voice entry technique and open source code systems to develop a low-cost, automated solution to allow primary care physicians to complete a primary care note entirely during the patient examination process. The narrative speech input will be analyzed in a context-sensitive, domain-restricted manner to produce structured clinical data that can be readily integrated into standards-compliant electronic medical records. By using speech inputs that are converted directly to relevant EHR entries, physicians can increase the accuracy of their notes, eliminate third party transcription errors and avoid workflow delays. The project approach will include:    Further testing and final development of DocTalk, the IDC patent pending speech system that allows accurate natural language processing of structured medical information; Development of a proof-of-concept data system that converts physician voice input from voice to text to structured text to EHR data using domain enhanced open source code; The evaluation of the effectiveness of the proof-of-concept system against traditional EHR  input methods with the following goals: Achieve 50% or more reduction in charting time,  achieve 90% or more accuracy in output, and score greater than 4 of 5 on subjective  metrics including learnability, workflow fit, usability, and overall satisfaction. Successful completion of the proposed program will provide IDC with a viable technology platform that can immediately be useful to primary care physicians in generating structured documents for use with their current EHR platforms. Furthermore, the technology developed and refined within this program can be expanded in multiple ways.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point. IDC will provide physicians who currently use pen and paper a more natural and faster way to input clinical data, eliminating time spent on hunt-and-peck keyboard entry or complicated EHR screen navigation. The system will generate structured clinical data that enables the exchange of health information, the portability of patient records, billing, data analytics (both local practice and public health), marketing, and other benefits, resulting in the reduction of overall healthcare costs.           Narrative The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Mining Internet Conversation For Evidence Of Herbal Association    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events Abstract This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10), Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Informatics for Post- Marketing Surveillance. Often, users of online resources such as discussion boards seek advice about topics they are hesitant to discuss with providers. One such topic is the use of herbal supplements. Relatively little is known about the use and effects of these supplements, primarily due to patient and provider reticence, but also owing to the lack of a formal reporting mechanism. As a result, adverse events and interactions possibly related to herbal use are difficult to evaluate in a population-based investigation. The potential impact for monitoring side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals is highly important. The goal of this project is to develop, apply, and evaluate computational intelligence tools for mining conversational text for evidence of adverse events and side effects of herbals and prescription drugs reported by users of online communication resources relating to breast and prostate cancer. This project will use these informatics tools as the cornerstone of a new approach to post-marketing surveillance, and has been determined by the National Library of Medicine to be responsive to the stated Challenge Topic. This project will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, which contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, the School created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity. This project will create or retain eight jobs. The School's ability to fill these positions is evident: in 2008, Penn received more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open staff research positions. Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms. In mining the text from such online, new information about side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals will be discovered. This is highly important for the health of the public, as it stands to create the framework for an herbal sentinel network system.              Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,7940855,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2010,417999,0.022448478134037393

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7933293,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,152617,0.04543704985190975
"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known. In this project we will design a system for analyzing the information about statin side effects in the electronic medical records.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public.              n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7672256,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'fourth grade', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'ninth grade', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tenth grade', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2009,398216,0.021410568763947833
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7908950,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,17240,0.06672504007455361
"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them. We hypothesize that we will develop effective methods aimed at improving our understanding of rare diseases by combining hypothesis testing and hypothesis discovery, and by integrating information from the literature and from the patient record to obtain increased statistical power. This will involve using natural language processing and statistical methods to mine both the literature and the electronic health record (EHR).           Project Narrative We will test reported associations in rare diseases and discover new ones by integrating information from the literature and from Electronic Health Records in hospitals.",Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases,7727710,R01LM010140,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Informatics', 'Information Theory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'blind', 'data mining', 'forgetting', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virology', 'web site']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,533007,0.013240273060156703
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records    DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.      Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of   cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is   one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language   processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from   existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related   epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.      SPECIAL REVIEW NOTE: In order to conform to the scientific objectives outlined in the program announcement RFA-GM-09-008, EUREKA applications submitted to the NCI were initially evaluated by a group of reviewers representing diverse scientific interests.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,0.024186068710148785

"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts.

"Early Warning Method and Technologies for Improving Cancer Care and Targeted Inte    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial evidence gathered over the last 50 years shows that adherence poses a crucial barrier to effective treatment and survival for cancer and other chronic diseases. At least one in five cancer patients do not adhere to treatment regimen, with much higher disease-specific rates. This non-adherence, or deviation from the recommended and expected clinical path, can dramatically increase costs of care, hospitalizations, adverse outcomes and the chance of preventable death. What causes non-adherence to treatment regimens is currently not rigorously understood. Current adherence research methods largely rely on survey instruments that have limited scale and scope, provide lagging information that inhibits timely intervention, and offer little actionable information to help patients to adhere to their care regimens. Further, the nature and timing of intervention to improve adherence have not been researched in depth. With continuous changes in cancer treatment, newer proactive approaches and methods for surveillance of patient adherence and targeted interventions are needed. In this project, we examine the feasibility and validity of a novel approach that uses a computational model to glean fine-grained attributes of cancer patients from standard electronic medical records. Our preliminary work has shown that electronic records to contain free-form text describing patient sentiment, vitals, medical condition, side effects, social history and family status written by physicians, nurses, medical assistants, and other staff during every visit encounter. With the steady adoption of electronic medical records by clinicians across the US (currently 29% and rising at 12% per year), clinical notes found in electronic records offer a tantalizing source of insight into patient adherence and behavior. Current adherence research has not tapped this rich source of data, even though many disciplines including biomedical informatics have employed natural language processing and text-mining techniques to glean patterns in semi- structured biomedical data. We aim to employ similar but novel, scalable computational models to glean a rich set of risk factors for patient non-adherence from 1 million patient encounter records, corresponding to 24,050 patients that span a 10 year time-horizon. Our objectives are to estimate the risk of a patient's ability to adhere to a prescribed regimen and enable targeted and timely interventions by using computational analysis of unstructured and structured fields in standard clinical documentation.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to show the feasibility of an early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient's risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records. This technology has tremendous relevance for improved quality of care, proactive management of chronic diseases and patient safety.                        Project Narrative We aim to show the feasibility of an early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient's risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication reconciliation will be assessed.",Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts,7774682,R03HS018288,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2009,48782,0.00942194883813961
"Mining Internet Conversation For Evidence Of Herbal Association    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events Abstract This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10), Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Informatics for Post- Marketing Surveillance. Often, users of online resources such as discussion boards seek advice about topics they are hesitant to discuss with providers. One such topic is the use of herbal supplements. Relatively little is known about the use and effects of these supplements, primarily due to patient and provider reticence, but also owing to the lack of a formal reporting mechanism. As a result, adverse events and interactions possibly related to herbal use are difficult to evaluate in a population-based investigation. The potential impact for monitoring side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals is highly important. The goal of this project is to develop, apply, and evaluate computational intelligence tools for mining conversational text for evidence of adverse events and side effects of herbals and prescription drugs reported by users of online communication resources relating to breast and prostate cancer. This project will use these informatics tools as the cornerstone of a new approach to post-marketing surveillance, and has been determined by the National Library of Medicine to be responsive to the stated Challenge Topic. This project will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, which contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, the School created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity. This project will create or retain eight jobs. The School's ability to fill these positions is evident: in 2008, Penn received more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open staff research positions. Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms. In mining the text from such online, new information about side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals will be discovered. This is highly important for the health of the public, as it stands to create the framework for an herbal sentinel network system.              Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,7767483,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,314000,0.022448478134037393
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records.

"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7677599,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2008,20000,0.009823229022616639
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7326883,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2007,99773,0.009823229022616639
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts.

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7282343,K22LM008805,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Applications Grants', 'Caring', 'Causations', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Negligence', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States', 'base', 'computerized', 'concept', 'experience', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2007,135000,0.02473086129112432

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7249382,R01EB000362,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Geographic Locations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Multimedia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Visit', 'base', 'concept', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'peer', 'point of care', 'portability', 'research clinical testing', 'urologic', 'usability']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,517331,-0.0005123794844127583

"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%.

"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serveCDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections PreventiveService, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrometest characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CMcode groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndromedefinitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health. Operation of this system will protect the public health and will strengthen the capacity of public health officials to investigate and respond to these threats rapidly. n/a",The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection,7428896,R01PH000038,[' '],PHPPO,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2007,415565,0.004741193640441834
"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records. The product of the first research goal will be a model for respiratory syndromic case detection for monitoring natural and bioterrorism induced respiratory outbreaks. Second, she will apply existing methods and develop new techniques for extracting clinical conditions required for respiratory case detection from emergency department notes, contributing new knowledge to the medical language processing field using sentence and report level models that account for uncertainty, negation, and temporal occurrence. The product of the second goal will be a better understanding of the information required for accurate detection of respiratory related conditions from text and useful tools for automatically extracting that information. Third, she will teach, promote, and facilitate the use of natural language processing in the biomedical informatics field. The product of the third goal will be a graduate class surveying medical language processing methodology and applications and development of general tools sets for researchers who need encoded data from textual patient records.        The proposed research will focus on:   Aim 1. Development and evaluation of a respiratory case detection model;   Aim 2. Integration of existing natural language processing tools and development of new methodologies for extracting clinical conditions needed for respiratory case detection from textual records; and   Aim 3.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events.

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems.

"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records. The product of the first research goal will be a model for respiratory syndromic case detection for monitoring natural and bioterrorism induced respiratory outbreaks. Second, she will apply existing methods and develop new techniques for extracting clinical conditions required for respiratory case detection from emergency department notes, contributing new knowledge to the medical language processing field using sentence and report level models that account for uncertainty, negation, and temporal occurrence.

"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution.  n/a",Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing,7098649,R01PH000022,"['abstracting', 'artificial intelligence', 'biohazard detection', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'environmental health', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'model design /development', 'public health', 'rapid diagnosis', 'vocabulary development for information system']",PHPPO,MAYO CLINIC,R01,2005,514616,0.020362604807088163
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6892934,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,384538,0.01146424793944262

"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6802698,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'information systems', 'medical records', 'online computer', 'primary care physician', 'vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,437194,0.03451646386669938

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6630735,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', ' classification', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,377617,0.01146424793944262
"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures. This project represents a unique opportunity to apply the most advanced medical language processing system to a large, comprehensive clinical repository to advance patient safety research.  n/a",Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research,6657426,R18HS011806,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health service demonstration project', ' human data', ' iatrogenic disease', ' patient care', ' patient safety /medical error']",AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R18,2003,369494,0.050341289858735566
"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6665504,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,424735,0.03451646386669938
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6678913,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information display', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,572597,-0.0005123794844127583
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature.

"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,9933852,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'social observations', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,332269,0.018721060593737144

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); In recent years, there has been increasing evidence supporting the role of DSs in ADRD in preventing cognitive impairment but there is limited evidence and the sample sizes have been small. Real- world data (RWD) especially the EHR contain detailed treatment and response information from patients and could be used to detect the usage and effect of DSs, DSIs, which is more translational to clinical outcomes (e.g., MCI to ADRD conversion). To the best of our knowledge, there is no investigation on DSs usage and safety among patients in MCI and ADRD using EHR data. Our current parent award is focusing on the development of a translational informatics framework to enable the discovery of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) by linking scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. To response to NOT-AG-20-008, this administrative supplement application will complement our parent award in multiple aspects: (1) developing novel and advanced data analytic methods for mining RWD in EHR, (2) identifying DSs usage information among patients with ADRD, and (3) detecting safety and effect of DS among patients with ADRD from existing EHR data. In our preliminary work, we have investigated the methods to identify DSs terms on EHR and developed natural language processing (NLP) methods to identify use status of DSs. We will further our efforts to collect a EHR dataset with DSs usage and AE-DSs signals from AD patients and develop innovative informatics methods to extract such information. Our specific aims are: (1) identifying DSs usage among patients with MCI and ADRD from existing EHR data; and (2) detecting the DSs safety signals and exploring the effect of DSs use on the conversion from MCI to ADRD from existing EHR data. The successful completion of this project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this administrative supplement application, we will evaluate the usage and safety of dietary supplements (DSs) usage in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), respectively using electronic health records (EHR) data. We will also explore the feasibility of using EHR to detect DS effect on the conversion from MCI to ADRD. This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in DSs and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. The successful accomplishment of this supplement project will deliver a novel informatics methods and generate DSI signals among patients with ADRD.

"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,0.02680590516000937

"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10003310,R01HS026246,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,390145,0.024960646072150056
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9852435,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'smoking cessation', 'structured data', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vape pens']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,0.01621138800080825
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career.

"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9995499,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'automated algorithm', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization', 'unstructured data']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2020,238049,0.010959781814428872
"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10098792,R01HS027811,[' '],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,398528,0.03434967329298534
"Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. Numerous healthcare providers have adopted these systems, which provide a framework for healthcare provlder staff to report patient safety events. Public databases like MAUDE and VAERS have also been created to collect and trend safety events across healthcare systems. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter ls not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely descrlbe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) ldentifylng document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. An important advantage of our research team is the involvement of healthcare domain experts and access to frontline staff, and we will leverage this strength to develop our algorithms. A key feature of our work is the generalizability of our methods, which will be applicable to biomedical documents arising across a remarkable variety of areas, such as patient safety and equipment malfunction reports, electronic health records, adverse drug or vaccine reports, etc. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, despite the frequently cited Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that first brought attention to the problem over ten years ago. Identifying temporal trends and patterns in the data is particularly important to improving patient safety and patient care.

"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,9882529,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,328000,-0.0044890741529655075
"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format with tremendous potential but an equally large concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potential for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary use of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious and costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for higher accuracy and much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to advance a text de-identification system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the research infrastructure at our implementation and testing site (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), and ready for commercialization efforts. To accomplish this undertaking, we will focus on the following specific aims and related objectives, while continuing to prepare the commercialization of the integrated system, with detailed market analysis, commercial roadmap development, and modern media communication: 1) Enhance the text de-identification system performance, scalability, and quality to produce an enterprise-grade solution ready for deployment; 2) Enable use of structured data for enhanced text de-identification (when structured PII is available) and for complete patient records de-identification (i.e., records combining structured and unstructured data). This aim also includes implementing “one-way” pseudo-identifier cryptographic hashing to enable securely linking already de-identified patient records; 3) Integrate the text de-identification system with a research data capture and management system. This includes implementation of the de-identification system as a secure web service, with standards-based access and integration. This de-identification system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will ease research data sharing (as expected for larger NIH-funded research projects) and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. Significant time-savings will also be offered, with a process at least 200-1000 times faster than manual de-identification.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased patient volumes and increased patient acuity, leading to an excessive burden on many healthcare facilities across the United States. This greatly increases the risk of patient safety consequences arising from malfunctioning medical equipment or adverse reaction to medication. To ensure patient safety and the highest quality of healthcare during this crisis, we need a rapid response system to model and analyze COVID-specific safety issues at scale, and quickly disseminate the results to healthcare facilities, so that these risks can be mitigated at the point of care. In this supplement, we propose to do this by (a) mining public databases and EHRs to identify devices/medication being used for treating COVID and (b) applying our methods (based on NLP, SPC, and SPM) to understand risks associated with these items.

"Transforming Patient Safety Event Data into Actionable Insights through Advanced Analytics Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to develop an innovative algorithms and a software tool to reduce the burden of safety event report classification and analysis so that report data can be transformed to actionable insights. Making safety event data more actionable will support the proactive identification of safety hazards before patients are harmed. We will achieve our research objective through (1) the development of natural language processing algorithms to classify safety event reports into actionable medication error categories; (2) the development of prototype software that will automatically categorize and visualize safety event reports to support trend identification; and (3) the pilot testing of prototype software with hospital and patient safety organization safety analysts. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, including computer science, specifically regarding information retrieval and data classification. Our research team includes patient safety organizations and collaboration with the computer science department at Georgetown University. The proposal is directly aligned with AHRQ’s priority area of making health care safer. Contributions from this research will include an expansion of our understanding of natural language processing and its application to categorizing clinical text, advances in visual analytics, and the development of a software tool to support patient safety analysts. The outputs of this research will serve both healthcare organizations and patient safety organizations allowing them to more efficiently and effectively analyze safety report data.

"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems.

"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,0.025632205822533633
