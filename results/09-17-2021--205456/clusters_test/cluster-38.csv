"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,10122959,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,16342
"Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development Abstract Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth, morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi- omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq, bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super- enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic, Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and career development to help me achieve these goals. Project Narrative Human craniofacial development is a complex process and requires suites of genes to be switched on and off at appropriate times and spaces during formation of the embryo. There is now a wealth of data available in public databases concerning which genes are expressed when and where during mammalian facial development, including for the transcription factors which are the proteins that regulate these critical expression programs, but we have not yet begun to connect this information together to derive logical predictions about the critical networks responsible for craniofacial development. This proposal will address that gap using both computational and laboratory-based methods to derive and verify transcriptional regulatory networks relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of normal facial development as well as how these are disrupted to cause defects such as human orofacial clefting.",Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development,10284443,K01DE030923,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dental', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Validation', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'bone', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'critical period', 'design', 'differential expression', 'in silico', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'next generation', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tenure track', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2021,130135
"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain Stem', 'Clinical', 'Cochlea', 'Cohort Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Protection', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outcome Study', 'Outer Hair Cells', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Students', 'System', 'Temporary Threshold Shift', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cochlear synaptopathy', 'conditioning', 'demographics', 'dosimetry', 'ear muscle', 'farmer', 'hearing impairment', 'middle ear', 'musician', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'professor', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sound', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333
"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10263210,R01ES032140,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Caliber', 'Carbon', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Concentration measurement', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Outcome', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nickel', 'Nitrates', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Sulfate', 'Supercomputing', 'Tennessee', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'land use', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'particle', 'response', 'study population', 'years of life lost']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,547223
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,10174601,U01AA014809,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'algorithm development', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2021,225264
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,10200044,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2021,183893
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody. Specific Aim #1: Operationalize spatio-temporal CyanoHAB exposure epoch metrics  • Fuse multi-scale and disparate satellite remote sensing platforms and automate retrievals over  space and time to derive CyanoHAB exposure metrics. We will build enterprise software to fully  automate the harmonization and fusion of NASA’s Landsat-8 OLI and ESA’s Sentinel-2 and  Sentinel-3 satellite platforms to provide long-term (1984-present) moderate spatial resolution  (30meter pixels) and high temporal frequency CyanoHAB exposure metrics (Cyanobacteria  Intensity, Color Dissolved Organic Matter, Total Suspended Solids, Floating Algae Index,  Chlorophyll-a Concentration, & toxins). The decision support tool automates epoch synthesis to  understand incubation periods and exposure triggers for neurodegenerative diseases. Specific Aim #2: Scale on-demand CHABMAP commercial product services  • Scale and implement CHABMAP data services for infinite scalability using BigData cloud  technologies. This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users. Ultimately, this  Aim will allow for the assessment and monitoring of CyanoHAB conditions for any waterbody or  region (i.e., North America) on the planet. Specific Aim #3: Execute risk assessment frameworks with public health partners  • We will work in partnership with Cleveland Clinic, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,  University of Miami, Macquarie University, NIH’s Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section and  CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (National ALS Registry) to assess the role  of CyanoHABs exposure as a risk factor for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using patients,  clinic-, and population-based controls across diverse settings and geographies. Each application  end user has ongoing risk assessment frameworks (i.e., Gene-Environment, Residential History  Machine Learning, eco-epidemiological, molecular biology) which our CHABMAP technology will  integrate exposure epoch metrics to understand the etiology or ALS and support drug discovery. Proposed Innovation CHABMAP technology automates the quantification of toxic Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom (CHAB) exposure epochs for any waterbody or catchment in the world for the past four decades using multi-scale harmonized satellites.

"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),10128453,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'data visualization', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2021,2152873
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,10120729,K23MH113708,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Severities', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'statistics', 'theories', 'treatment of anxiety disorders']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,186408
"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10271405,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,499609
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,10078271,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'detection limit', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,513804
"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,10146388,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data repository', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,190241
"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.

"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9841303,R01DC014498,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317844
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,10132972,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'lateral flow assay', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'serosurveillance', 'serosurvey', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,663407
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.

"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects. Findings of our study will ultimately result in precision risk assessment and precision prevention strategies to improve human health worldwide.",Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment,10109116,R01ES031322,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '4 year old', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrazine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family health status', 'Food Supply', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herbicides', 'Human', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Insecticides', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paraquat', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pentachlorophenol', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Phenotype', 'Phorate', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probiotics', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water Supply', 'acaricide', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'brain tissue', 'carcinogenesis', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'drinking water', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'glyphosate', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'individualized prevention', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbial composition', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome sequencing', 'motor behavior', 'mouse model', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pesticide exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sample collection', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2021,281700
