"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,9821134,K23MH118361,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alaska', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empathy', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Idaho', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Montana', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Partnership Practice', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Trauma Nursing', 'Trauma patient', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Wyoming', 'base', 'care providers', 'college', 'computerized', 'coping', 'evidence base', 'feasibility trial', 'health care settings', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevention clinical trial', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'responsible research conduct', 'safety net', 'screening', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'task analysis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'trauma units', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,154695,0.07622509107002416
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9772123,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2019,50016,0.09363410316440551
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9743863,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,720889,0.07024724123789454
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9655181,R21HL145427,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Carotid Endarterectomy', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Carotid stent', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcification', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2019,121619,0.15266929622815395
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9762979,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,513970,0.09656131539642428
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,9801981,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,709389,0.025235270513880543
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,9762241,K08NS109315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Writing', 'brain behavior', 'brain cell', 'career', 'career development', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'disability', 'disability burden', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'meetings', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'nervous system disorder', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory cortex', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,213840,0.09014364885427911
"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data",9714930,R01MH119177,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Data', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'demographics', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insurance claims', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'model design', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric emergency', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'validation studies']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,779940,0.12279546385759753
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9778912,K02NS104207,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'response', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke model', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2019,220478,0.1585592947825885
"Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Similar trends exist in the U.S., where it is estimated that every 40 seconds a stroke occurs, leading to a stroke-related death every 4 minutes. Afflicting approximately 800,000 Americans each year, time sensitive and widely practicable diagnostic algorithms are paramount. Despite increasing emphasis on the significance of blood flow characteristics in pursuing strokes, estimating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) inside the skull is no trivial task. Imaging techniques that provide rCBF distribution may be unavailable due to time constraint or access to facilities, or simply the expenses attached to it. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a model that can give blood flow estimates in real-time for the entire brain vasculature. Here, we propose a novel hybrid computational model that utilizes high-performance computing and machine learning to simulate the entire brain vasculature, as well as provide real time measures of regional CBF. We will use novel mathematical methods to determine the vascular geometry of each subject using our existing imaging database that includes CTA and CBF images from stroke patients, and will subsequently validate our simulations against the same dataset. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to extract patterns in stroke patients' blood flow and give estimates for stroke severity predictors on patient- specific measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this project is to estimate blood flow properties in the brain and its correlation with stroke. We will simulate and validate a model to give similar information as the expensive perfusion scanning measurements. Through Machine Learning algorithms, we will provide severity estimates for stroke patients for more informed clinical decisions and better patient care.",Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment,9746155,R03NS108167,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cerebrum', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Gaussian model', 'Geometry', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical translation', 'cranium', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'perfusion imaging', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'tool', 'trend']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2019,82032,0.1286251427821164
"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,9834058,F31MH120973,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fellowship', 'Foster Home Care', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Workers', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abuse neglect', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'child protective service', 'cohort', 'experience', 'foster care', 'health service use', 'high school', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'opioid epidemic', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'response', 'service intervention', 'stem', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.08676805692214277
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9726113,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,531215,0.12998536829435067
"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9663209,K01HD091283,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Nature', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical Medicine', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wolves', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'computerized tools', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional improvement', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'muscle strength', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K01,2019,133191,0.14389970174246317
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9716663,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,723673,0.06131196809976856
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9689114,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Assessment tool', 'Biometry', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,353843,0.08630266963157843
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",9714475,R01NS110779,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Aminocaproic Acids', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents', 'Aspirin', 'Blood Coagulation Factor VII', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Desmopressin', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Factor VIIa', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hypomagnesemia', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Texas', 'Thrombelastography', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain tissue', 'clopidogrel', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metropolitan', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'stroke trials', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,632829,0.048971029205953476
"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,9658750,R01MH115922,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'Violence', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'individual response', 'men', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'physical abuse', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'respiratory', 'response', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,752187,0.10971006845830629
"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),9713571,R01AG062770,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Aspirin', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Coagulation Process', 'Community Practice', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'European', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clopidogrel', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disability', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'preference', 'prevent', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,510532,0.11173365810274748
"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke.

"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9674421,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,2193618,0.0820734158659253
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9773224,U01MH116923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Geography', 'High School Student', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Music', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Value', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'bullying', 'clinical care', 'diaries', 'emotional distress', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'longitudinal design', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social deficits', 'social media', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,U01,2019,721420,0.07779105213806531
"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke. This will facilitate important recovery research that is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability. The quantitative methodology will advance data-driven discovery in the presence of nuisance variables, which is relevant to biomedical research applications such as diagnostics, genetics, and imaging.",Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha   ,9916457,R01LM013316,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Electronics', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'network models', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation']",NLM,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,300000,0.14142300488872384
"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9753311,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Movement', 'Nervous system structure', 'Paresis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Step training', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'foot', 'functional independence', 'gait rehabilitation', 'hemiparesis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'locomotor control', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'social stigma', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'treadmill', 'treadmill training', 'visual feedback', 'walking speed']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,381129,0.12752937724472702
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia.

We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9981076,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,103338,0.07441957204224312
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9609472,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,739858,0.20018805815423135
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,9774940,R44MH118780,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Tests', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'data visualization', 'design', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychiatric emergency', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide model', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2019,224998,0.10049082463642676
"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility",9845173,R44HL145826,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteriogram', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stroke', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'base', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebral vein', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NHLBI,"MAGNETIC RESONANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2019,214510,0.012651374737324136
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9650647,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Leukocytes', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'platelet function', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,552408,0.19926180271566085
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations. Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9679513,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,740058,0.123387787930884

This restriction does not limit the NIH's right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from  another source without restriction. This legend applies to the Abstract, Specific Aims, Research Plan (al components), Commercialization Plan, and Human Subject's Sections of this proposal. Abstract The AHA Stroke Rehabilitation guideline states that in the current fiscal climate, “the provision of comprehensive rehabilitation programs with adequate resources, dose, and duration is an essential aspect of stroke care and should be a priority” [1]. While near and long-term rehabilitation goals should be guided by patient baseline motor status and potential for motor recovery [2-12], acute motor assessment and prognostication remain a clinically difficult task [13, 14]. Conventional clinical assessments (e.g. NIH Stroke Scale, Fugl-Meyer (FM) Scale) [15, 16] that power prognosis are highly dependent on the initial severity and care provider/point of care, and often reduced further to even coarser prognostic scales (e.g. Orpington Prognostic Scale (OPS)) [17]. Overall they lack the level of sophistication required to predict motor recovery and tailor rehabilitation due to ceiling effects, omission of fractionated and complex distal movements, and/or unequal weighting of the two extremities in assessments [18]. Furthermore, many survivors do not even receive comprehensive assessments prior to discharge, and telestroke approaches which are being implemented to address such issues are limited in their scope of care and still not fully developed for functional assessments [19-23]. This is critical because “all patients benefit from a formal assessment of the patient’s rehabilitation needs prior to discharge” [24]. To address these and other limitations the AHA guidelines specifically call for the development of “computer-adapted assessments for personalized and tailored interventions”, “newer technologies such as…body-worn sensors”, and “better predictor models to identify responders and nonresponders” [1]. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a system of multimodal, integrated sensors (i.e., motion capture cameras, force sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes) that will interface with a patient for recording their movement; a software suite with signal processing and data fusion algorithms to reduce data dimensionality and provide kinematic/kinetic based evaluations; and system software to track, classify, and predict patient disease severity. We will test this computational Integrated sensor-based Motion Analysis Suite (IMAS) in 30 stroke patients undergoing IMAS directed motor evaluations (repeated 4 times in a 2 day period) within 5 days post stroke and 6-8 weeks post stroke (after having undergone rehabilitation) focused on assessments identified as important to patient independence, activities of daily living, and ability to return to work. Quantitative kinematic/kinetic metrics descriptive of motor behavior will be derived from IMAS sensor recordings to characterize subjects’ motor performance (e.g., joint displacement, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and movement quality measures). Then, we will investigate the statistical relationships between the IMAS collected data (and with additional clinical data gathered during the patient assessments including demographics; imaging derived information; and FM, OPS, and Barthel index scores) to build statistical models to: 1. extract a low dimensional representation of disease state, 2. predict the FM scale, and 3. predict likelihood of motor recovery following treatment. Project Narrative Stroke is a major cause of death and the leading cause of disability. In the clinic, the lack of quantitative, objective methods for outcome assessment and outcome prediction considerably hamper management of the disease, ultimately leading to sub-optimal strategies for managing patient care. This study will develop a motion analysis suite for quantitative, objective outcome assessment and prediction in stroke patients.",Stroke Assessment Suite,9845982,R43NS113737,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'arm movement', 'base', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'deviant', 'disability', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'model development', 'motor recovery', 'motor symptom', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'responders and non-responders', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'software systems', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"HIGHLAND INSTRUMENTS, INC.",R43,2019,224406,0.10190155508058865
"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt,9824639,R03MH118609,"['Arousal', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Glutamates', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention strategy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Societies', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive control', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'depressive symptoms', 'falls', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabotropic glutamate receptor 5', 'molecular imaging', 'mood regulation', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'radioligand', 'radiotracer', 'reducing suicide', 'relating to nervous system', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'targeted agent', 'translational impact', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,83750,0.11381913945365893
"Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this study is to develop an objective tool for the fast and easy assessment of stroke, by developing a novel analytics platform that quickly identifies potential stroke from movement signatures captured with wearable sensors. The tool uses unobtrusive wearable sensors and does not require medical training to operate, and thus will be valuable for families and caregivers of older Americans with high stroke risk who are either living at home or in an assisted living facility. Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans each year, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy for ischemic stroke since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room (ER) after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, specifically 4.5 hours and up to 24 hours in select patients, respectively. It is well established that treatment with tPA decreases the lifetime cost of stroke to third party payers by $25,000 per patient. As a result, health plans will be the ultimate economic buyer for this new technology. Here, we are not developing a new therapy for stroke, where so many others have failed. We seek, rather, to fill a well-accepted and clear gap for stroke patients: the early recognition of stroke symptoms that prevents them from accessing PROVEN but time dependent treatments in stroke, whose impact on outcomes is well established. Early identification of symptoms and timely treatment is the single most important determinant of outcomes in ischemic stroke. However, despite massive public health campaigns, most people do not identify stroke symptoms, resulting in costly delays in calling 9-1-1 and patients arriving in the hospital too late to benefit from ischemic stroke treatments. This is a growing problem, given the aging US population of which a significant portion lives at home alone, the staffing crisis at assisted living and nursing facilities, and the prevalence of stroke which is expected to increase by 20% by 2030. Given these trends, administrators and aging experts are increasingly recognizing the value of remote monitoring and aging in place initiatives. Thus, there a clear and urgent, unmet need for a method to assist untrained stroke victims, their families and caregivers in the early recognition of stroke. Bridging this gap with a fast, easy and objective solution would have significant public health impact, because millions of patients could access therapies in a window that is already known to improve outcomes for brain injury. To address this problem, we have leveraged our team’s unique expertise in stroke neurology and developed a set of activation tasks coupled with a wearable solution to assess and quantify ischemic stroke. Once deployed, our solution will improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies in the acute setting. NARRATIVE Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Though treatment for stroke has been available for over 20 years, only a very small number of eligible patients receive it because individuals who have suffered a stroke do not reach the emergency room in time. We have developed a method for quick, easy, real-time assessment for stroke, which will dramatically improve the number of patients receiving timely therapy after stroke and improve the outcome for stroke.",Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke,9847511,R43NS110338,"['Accelerometer', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency response', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Innovation Corps', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Limb structure', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurologist', 'Nurses', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Third-Party Payer', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aging in place', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disability', 'health plan', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'motor impairment', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phase 1 study', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sex', 'societal costs', 'standard of care', 'stroke neurology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke symptom', 'stroke therapy', 'stroke victims', 'tool', 'trend', 'volunteer', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"ALVA HEALTH, INC.",R43,2019,256988,0.2078798176278419
"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population,9597913,R21MH115344,"['12 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adult', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Community Surveys', 'Comorbidity', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gays', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Hate', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterosexuals', 'Homicide', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Sizes', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Services', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'experience', 'gender minority', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'illicit drug use', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'men', 'mortality disparity', 'novel', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'screening', 'sexual minority', 'social stigma', 'stressor', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide mortality', 'suicide rate', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'transgender', 'trend', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,185853,0.08446891097231181
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) To address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors. Aphasia, a language impairment caused by damage to the brain's language regions, persists chronically in approximately 30% of stroke survivors. POLAR is a treatment study that aims to identify neuroanatomical, behavioral, genetic, and demographic predictors of treated aphasia recovery in individuals with chronic left hemisphere stroke. Preliminary analyses have shown that not all individuals improve, and recent evidence suggests that approximately one-quarter of individuals with post-stroke aphasia experience cognitive-linguistic decline over time. The purpose of this project is to extend the follow-up window for the POLAR study, to one-year post aphasia treatment. There is evidence to suggest that declining performance in stroke-induced aphasia is attributed to pathologic changes in the brain's white matter, referred to as leukoaraiosis. Leukoaraiosis is common in stroke survivors, and is often attributed to age, as well as cardiovascular health and other health concerns. In the general population, it has been associated with cognitive decline and loss of functional ability. By extending follow-up interval for the POLAR study, this study will address a new aim of evaluating the progression of leukoaraiosis and how it affects overall cognitive-linguistic ability in stroke survivors. To this end, participants will undergo the same speech/language and cognitive testing administered at study baseline. Participants will also undergo the same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol as at baseline (see the attached POLAR Research Strategy). The extent of behavioral change will be evaluated and related to neuroanatomical changes. The role of cognitive reserve and other personal factors in mediating the effects of leukoaraiosis will also be explored. The world’s population is aging, and with this trend, the global burden of stroke and dementia is also increasing. The study of leukoaraiosis in post-stroke aphasia is critical for identifying factors that may indicate cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors, as doing so will also inform efforts to improve the evaluation of individuals at risk for developing cognitive impairment, AD, and other dementias (NIA Strategic Goal D-3). The world’s population is aging, and by 2050, it is expected that 17% of the world’s population (i.e., 1.6 billion people) will be over the age of 65 (1). Along with this increase in older individuals, the global burden of stroke (2) and dementia (3) is also increasing. The coming decades are expected to see a significant growth in the number of individuals living longer with post-stroke sequelae, attributed to the decline in stroke mortality rates (2, 4) and an increase in stroke rates in younger individuals (e.g., 20-44 years old (5); 45-64 years old (6)). In parallel, as individuals age, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias continues to increase (3). This epidemiological trend means that aging research must consider the effects of stroke on the aging brain – and likewise – stroke research must consider how processes associated with aging affect long term outcomes. In essence, stroke survivors are aging, and aging research must consider this population, especially considering that by 2030, the number of stroke survivors could reach 70 million people worldwide (2). Accordingly, to address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (CSTAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9951329,P50DC014664,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Employment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Leukoaraiosis', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aging brain', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'cardiovascular health', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive reserve', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'hemisphere damage', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'post stroke', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,372500,0.0992303958299443
"Development and Acceptability of an Ambient In-Home Activity Assessment Tool for Stroke 1. Project Summary/Abstract  Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not exercise or engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. One-on- one rehabilitation sessions are frequently limited in number due to insurance regulations and therapists (physical and occupational) frequently prescribe home-based exercise programs. These programs historically have low adherence rates and patient report can often be biased, incomplete, or inaccurate. Wearable sensors can track amount of activity but these sensors are limited in scope and cannot discern between various activities. Depth sensors can be used in the home to detect falls and monitor in-home gait patterns of well older adults. Other researchers have used depth sensors to detect and discern activities in laboratories or mock home environments with a population without any disabilities. In this proposal, the Daily Activity Recognition and Assessment System (DARAS) will merge prior ambient depth sensor work with newly developed algorithms to objectively and accurately measure the amount and type of activity of people with stroke living at home. This will be completed in three specific aims. The DARAS algorithms will be developed and refined for recognizing activities of people with stroke in the kitchen environment using the Foresite depth sensor. These algorithms will be trained using real-world data from lab-based testing with individuals with stroke (n =10). We will refine the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based algorithm for accurately segmenting and recognizing activities from untrimmed processing of depth videos. The developed activity recognition system will be deployed in the homes of 10 individuals with stroke over the course of 1 year. To determine the impact on daily life and acceptability of the system and generated data, focus groups will be held with 10 individuals with stroke. The DARAS developed in this proposal will provide a novel outcome assessment for a variety of post-stroke interventions and provide occupational therapists the ability to detect declines in performance early on and intervene. 8. Project Narrative Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a second stroke. Self-monitoring and self-report of home-based activity and exercise is highly subjective and provides little value to rehabilitation clinicians and their clients with stroke.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all. This proposal addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients.

"Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging Project Summary Every four minutes an American dies from stroke, equating to approximately 1 in every 19 US deaths annually. Strokes are classiﬁed as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes make up 87% of all strokes and are caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (or artery) resulting in a lack of blood to the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures releasing excess blood in or around the brain. Incorrect classiﬁcation can have dire consequences as treating a patient suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke (bleed) with anticoagulant drugs (used to dissolve blood clots for ischemic strokes) can prove fatal. Early action is of the utmost importance as each passing minute that brain cells lack the proper blood ﬂow additional cells die. Current classiﬁcation methods require tests performed at the hospital, e.g., CT or MRI scans of the patient's brain, leading to treatment delays. These delays are particularly lengthy for patients living in rural communities.  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that is inexpensive, has no ionizing radiation, and provides portable high-contrast images using harmless surface current and voltage measurements (e.g., on the head using a ﬂexible hat) to recover the internal point-wise electrical properties (e.g., inside the brain). EIT can recover conductivity, a measure of how easily current ﬂows through a material, as well as permittivity, a measure of the ability of a material to store a charge. A hemorrhagic stroke corresponds to an area of abnormally high conductivity due to the bleed, whereas an ischemic stroke presents as an area of lower conductivity than expected due cellular swelling from energy failure.  The proposed project addresses the important problem of early, fast, portable stroke classiﬁcation with EIT. A critical barrier for the use of EIT for stroke imaging has been the sensitivity of the image reconstruction algorithms to incorrect domain modeling and noise in the data. Due to these challenges, most research has focused on monitoring applications, not helpful for the classiﬁcation task. By contrast, the D-bar reconstruction method proposed here is the only proven noise and modeling error robust reconstruction method capable of recovering the true conductivity/permittivity using a low-pass ﬁltering in a nonlinear Fourier domain. D-bar methods have been successful in 2D but their development in 3D is stunted. This proposal focuses on the development of fast, robust D-bar based reconstruction methods for the 3D partial boundary problem, critical to working with stroke EIT data. Numerical algorithms will be developed for the full and partial boundary problems in 3D and validated on simulated and experimental data. A priori information, from anatomical atlases, will be embedded into the methods for increased resolution and stability. As the low-pass ﬁltering in D-bar methods leads to blurred reconstructions, post-processing through Convolutional Neural Networks will provide improved image quality. This work will be the ﬁrst to develop robust computational algorithms for 3D EIT data, opening the door for stroke imaging. Project Narrative Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), a portable imaging modality may provide early classiﬁcation of stroke type reducing treatment delays thus leading to improved patient outcomes. Existing image reconstruction algorithms for EIT are not robust to practical partial boundary data inherent to stroke imaging.

"Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms Abstract  The primary goal of this study is to develop an automated scoring system of leptomeningeal collaterals based on CT angiography (CTA) as a quantitative assessment of acute ischemic stroke. Leptomeningeal collaterals provide an alternate path of blood flow in the setting of a proximal vessel occlusion. The presence and effectiveness of leptomeningeal collaterals (i.e., “collateral status”) varies significantly from patient to patient. Collateral status has been shown to be correlated with both patient outcome and risk of hemorrhagic transformation, suggesting that rapid and accurate assessment of the collaterals would provide a powerful tool for treatment evaluation. The current gold standard for collateral scoring is performed by subjective analysis of retrograde filling in invasive digital subtraction angiograms (DSA). Though CTA is more limited than DSA in the direct evaluation of collaterals, the presence of collaterals may also be evaluated in CTA by the tree-pattern of vessel filling around the site of occlusion. Several manual assessment techniques based on CTA have been proposed in the literature, but all are subjective and require significant human intervention.  During Phase I, we deployed a web-based system for automated assessment of stroke collaterals based on CTA, and we used it in a preliminary study of collateral status for stroke assessment.  In this Phase II STTR proposal, the specific aims are (1) to improve the integration of our system with clinical workflows; (2) expand the system to also compute CT perfusion stroke measures, so as to provide a unified platform for comparing and combining CTA collateral and CT perfusion assessment metrics; and (3) test the hypotheses that the combined use of CTA collateral and CT perfusion measures outperforms either method independently for treatment efficacy prediction in stroke patients. Narrative  Leptomeningeal collateral vessels provide connections between vascular territories in the brain when occlusions occur, e.g., when a person suffers a stroke. The number and connectivity of collateral vessels varies significantly from patient to patient, and they have been shown to play an important role in stroke outcomes, providing blood flow to tissue at risk. Rapid and effective patient-specific determination of the presence and connectivity of collaterals is needed in acute stroke situations to determine which treatments will be effective. We propose to develop an automated system to evaluate collateral vessel trees from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images and to offer that system as an algorithms-as-a-service (AaaS) product.",Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms,9786246,R42NS086295,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Odds Ratio', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Triage', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'product development', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'statistics', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'thrombolysis', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'web services']",NINDS,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2019,487383,0.09622321149777148
"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation.",DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY,9918026,U19NS115388,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Dementia', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical application', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive disability', 'cognitive load', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'disability', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'morphometry', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'non-demented', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'post stroke cognitive impairment', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'stroke event', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tau Proteins', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U19,2019,5026638,0.15115235775936214
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9593921,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,797747,0.07024724123789454
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9593994,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,547151,0.09656131539642428
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9469853,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2018,49524,0.09363410316440551
"Addressing Suicide Research Gaps: Understanding Mortality Outcomes in the Mid-Atlantic Region  PROJECTSUMMARY Data linkage offers the potential to improve suicide risk surveillance as well as evaluate and enhance suicide prevention approaches. Data linkage could also allow for the identification of novel predictors or combinations of predictors to improve precision medicine efforts. The ability to access and analyze health care data has expanded dramatically in the past decade. The goal of this application is to leverage data from multiple sources including hospital discharges, insurance claims, death investigations, health information exchanges, and administrative data (e.g., civil status, employment status, legal system involvement, neighborhood characteristics, unemployment, gun ownership, arrests and incarceration). Aggregating these data systems will allow for novel secondary data analyses, which will enhance our understanding of risk and protective processes on suicide death in the Mid-Atlantic region. The aims of this project include identifying and merging existing clinical data sources (e.g., medical examiner, claims, hospital discharges), geo-level data sources and other clinical data (e.g., built environment, electronic health records), and aggregated administrative data (e.g., school, incarceration, gun ownership). Our team will develop predictive models using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. These models will be enhanced using spatial algorithms to detect the geo-clustering of suicide. The generalizability of data sources and analytic methods will be tested in the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia) to evaluate data availability, quality and data linkage feasibility. The methods of this project will be shared as a resource with other states and regions to establish a similar analytics framework to advance suicide prevention. Our team will develop national guidelines and technical support materials to facilitate data linkage and analysis based on common data sources available in most states. The project will offer essential benchmarks and measures for providers and payers to reduce suicide events in their systems.  PUBLICHEALTHRELEVANCE Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Over 44,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2015 and rates have increased 24% since 1999. This study will conduct data linkage and informatics approaches to utilize existing resources to improve suicide risk identification and prevention.",Addressing Suicide Research Gaps: Understanding Mortality Outcomes in the Mid-Atlantic Region,9750898,R56MH117560,"['Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Delaware', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employment Status', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Guns', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Legal system', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Examiners', 'Methods', 'Mid-Atlantic Region', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Population-Based Registry', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Violence', 'Virginia', 'West Virginia', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'data registry', 'electronic data', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'insurance claims', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'population survey', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'reducing suicide', 'resilience', 'screening', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide mortality', 'surveillance data']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R56,2018,491247,0.09579077759213692
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,9647161,K08NS109315,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Writing', 'brain behavior', 'brain cell', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'disability', 'disability burden', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'meetings', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'nervous system disorder', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory cortex', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2018,213840,0.09014364885427911
"Enhancing and extending the reach of suicide surveillance in tribal communities PROJECT SUMMARY The parent grant “Southwest Hub for American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Research” (U19 MH113136-01) aims to develop and test culturally appropriate prevention strategies, conduct outreach and dissemination within and across tribal communities, and enable key stakeholders to make science-based policy and related decisions. The overall goal is to leverage a collaborative network of tribal leaders, investigators, interventionalists, service providers and service users in the Southwest region to reduce suicide in American Indian youth ages 10-24. An administrative supplement is requested in order to build on our existing data collection platform to be more scalable and efficient when used across tribal settings. In collaboration with colleagues at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, we will set up the data collection platform to incorporate additional sites and capitalize on preliminary machine learning work to create easily interpretable risk flags that can help case-managers prioritize cases to reach and connect to care. This work will contribute to a better understanding of how to scale community based m-health platforms for use across diverse settings and how to operationalize and implement machine learning algorithms to help improve care. PROJECT NARRATIVE By strengthening the existing m-health suicide surveillance and case-management platform in the parent grant, these supplementary activities will pave the way for scale-up and enhancement of the system with novel risk detection methods across tribal settings.

"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9552938,K02NS104207,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke model', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2018,208791,0.1585592947825885
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9474690,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,681151,0.12998536829435067
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9543193,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,798597,0.06131196809976856
"A Functional Upper Limb Training and Assessment Tool to Enhance Efficacy and Scalability of Rehabilitation in Ecological Environments ABSTRACT Impairments following stroke make it one of the leading causes of disability. Many individuals with stroke do not recover complete function of the upper limb at time of discharge from clinical services . Moreover, early stage improvements may wane following the cessation of formal therapies. Regaining as much upper limb function as possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with limitations in daily function and lower health- related quality of life. Thus, finding ways to augment functional mobility is important. The overarching purpose of this project is to use portable technology, affordable for home use, to provide objective feedback on performance of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic conditions such as stroke. Objective feedback serves to better inform the participant of their progress and actively engage them in their rehabilitation, thus encouraging self-management of rehabilitation. Results from a recent survey shows therapists predominantly provide patients with stroke written home exercise programs at time of discharge from therapies. With this static approach, patients have a limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no encouragement to refine their movement. Creating automated systems that measure and provide feedback will promote a more proactive approach to maximizing function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. We propose that coupling smart technology found in readily available smartphones with three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a scalable option to provide feedback in long-term rehabilitation and advances the current standard of care, i.e. written home exercise programs. We will build upon our current research, further developing and validating a novel in-home rehabilitation system using 3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use emerging low- cost 3D printing techniques to augment off-the-shelf smart devices (e.g., smartphones) into functional rehabilitation tools. The built-in sensors and our machine learning apps in smartphones can quantify characteristics of movement and provide actionable feedbacks to users during in-home rehabilitation. We hypothesize that feedback will result in improved functional mobility. We will examine performance changes in common activities of daily living (ADLs) trained with our system. With the portable devices, we are able to go further than reporting the typical time metric and also provide feedback on smoothness of movement represented as a normalized cumulative jerk (rate of change of acceleration) score. This assessment provides information on control of movement, an indication of impairment. Recording normalized jerk over time and across activities is a promising way to assess change in impairment. Overall, this scalable design offers an innovative approach to long-term rehabilitation needs of individuals with stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions promoting optimum motor performance across the lifespan are a priority after a neurological insult such as stroke. The proposed research incorporates smart devices and 3D printing to create patient-centered rehabilitation devices that are scalable.

"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments.

"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9471878,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Assessment tool', 'Biometry', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,360343,0.08630266963157843
"Suicide Death Among Older Adults Receiving Residential Long-term Care Project Summary/Abstract  Suicide is among the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. and suicide risk increases substantially after age 65. Nearly 70% of individuals currently 65 years old will require long-term care during the remainder of their lives. The nation's 15,000 nursing homes are an important setting providing residential post-acute and long-term care to over 3 million older and disabled Americans every year, and the nation's 30,000 assisted living facilities provided a home to about 800,000 elders during 2013-14. Residents in the 2 types of long-term care facilities are often socially isolated, physically and cognitively disabled, and diagnosed with multiple mental and medical conditions, all of which are associated with suicide in older adults. As a result, they may show elevated risk taking their own lives compared to community-living elders despite the fact that long-term care facilities are able to monitor closely the daily activities of their residents. However, the actual suicide risk among these residents is largely unknown. Moreover, it is expected that organizational characteristics and overall ability of long-term care facilities to provide safe and high quality of care play an important role in shaping the risk of suicide for residents at different points of care. However, empirical evidence on these questions is extremely limited. This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, estimate suicide risk for nursing home residents at different points of care using longitudinal resident assessment records, and determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate. Organizational characteristics will be measured by nursing home structural factors (e.g. profit status), overall quality of care (e.g. measured by nurse staffing level), and organizational-level patient safety culture. This project will link the longitudinal National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and National Death Index (NDI) files to nursing home Minimum Data Sets (MDS) and Medicare beneficiary data, as well as other facility and state policy files. These data will be used to model resident risk for suicide death using cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods, quantify the variations in risk-adjusted suicide death rates at different levels (i.e. facility, region, and state levels), and test the hypotheses regarding organizational and policy impacts on suicide death. The information generated in this project will contribute to the knowledge of suicide burdens among the most vulnerable elders in need of residential long-term care. The knowledge gained will inform future organizational- and policy-level interventions to prevent suicide among elders receiving long-term care. Project Narrative This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, and to determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate.

"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9441869,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,560820,0.19926180271566085
"Prehospital and Emergency Room Stroke Diagnosis Using Quantitative Cerebral Hemodynamics Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. Although treatments including interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), there is not a rapid prehospital tool for diagnoses which guides the use of the correct therapy. Because the time to treatment for stroke is critical, there is a large need for a device which can be used in ambulances and other prehospital environments so that patients are rapidly provided the correct care. Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is the standard of care but its use is limited to the hospital or in some cases multimillion dollar stroke on wheels ambulances which are not practical. There is a significant delay that occurs between stroke onset and diagnosis by the time CTA is performed and read resulting in unnecessary death or disability. More delay occurs when patients need to be transferred to a stroke center because the hospital they are at does not perform interventional therapy. Rapid diagnosis in a prehospital setting will enable patients to be taken to the correct hospital and provide LVO location to surgeons in the operating suite.  As the critical factor affecting cerebral anatomy in AIS patients is the limitation of blood flow to the brain the most likely technology to assist in diagnosis of LVO is one that can measure flow directly. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has been used to directly measure blood flow velocity since 1982 but it relies on a trained operator skilled in both finding the affected vessel as well as interpreting a complicated waveform. Guidelines already exist for how to diagnose LVO with TCD and hospitals with a trained operator currently use it. However, it’s not used in smaller hospitals, urgent care or ambulance settings due to the training requirements.  This work will revolutionize TCD for stroke diagnosis because it removes the need for a trained operator; key for mass adoption of the technology. TCD is already small and portable so it can easily fit in an ambulance similar in size to an automated external defibrillator. This work will use machine learning techniques we have developed to analyze the morphology of TCD waveforms and provide diagnosis information. The key is the ability to remove the operator variability by understanding how waveform morphology of stroke changes based on depth relative to occlusion so that the need to measure in a precise location is eliminated. Our preliminary results show 95% accuracy for LVO diagnosis but we need to broaden our dataset while updating our algorithms. Phase I will use our FDA Cleared Lucid M1 Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System to measure confirmed stroke subjects after CTA imaging and update our algorithm. Phase II will use algorithms developed in Phase I with a fully automated TCD system we have developed with investor funding that does not require an operator or trained sonographer. We currently have Western IRB approval and are upgrading usability features of the device for ease of use with minimal training. Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. This work will reduce the time to treatment for stroke by developing necessary algorithms to diagnose AIS with a portable ultrasound technology which measures cerebral blood flow velocity.

"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,9543581,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Expression Profiling', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular risk factor', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,127821,0.09491092292943581
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9489301,R01MH085651,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Butter', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral study', 'biological heterogeneity', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'geriatric depression', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,482739,0.10205920439147156
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9455467,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2018,2212889,0.0820734158659253
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9579491,U01MH116923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Geography', 'High School Student', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Music', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Value', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'bullying', 'clinical care', 'diaries', 'emotional distress', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'longitudinal design', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social media', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,U01,2018,808067,0.07779105213806531
"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population,9436443,R21MH115344,"['12 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adult', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Community Surveys', 'Comorbidity', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gays', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Hate', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Heterosexuals', 'Homicide', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Sizes', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Services', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'experience', 'gender minority', 'health disparity', 'illicit drug use', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'men', 'mortality disparity', 'novel', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'screening', 'sexual minority', 'social stigma', 'stressor', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide mortality', 'suicide rate', 'theories', 'transgender', 'trend', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,224074,0.08446891097231181
"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9567461,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,762544,0.07441957204224312
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,9483275,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'language onset', 'language processing', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'perfusion imaging', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'stroke patient', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,417437,0.06806675244919402
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9389004,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,734204,0.20018805815423135
"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9524485,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Movement', 'Nervous system structure', 'Paresis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Step training', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'foot', 'gait rehabilitation', 'hemiparesis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'locomotor control', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'social stigma', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'treadmill', 'treadmill training', 'visual feedback', 'walking speed']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,381478,0.12752937724472702
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans.1 Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9523887,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2018,853336,0.123387787930884
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.

"Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms Abstract  The primary goal of this study is to develop an automated scoring system of leptomeningeal collaterals based on CT angiography (CTA) as a quantitative assessment of acute ischemic stroke. Leptomeningeal collaterals provide an alternate path of blood flow in the setting of a proximal vessel occlusion. The presence and effectiveness of leptomeningeal collaterals (i.e., “collateral status”) varies significantly from patient to patient. Collateral status has been shown to be correlated with both patient outcome and risk of hemorrhagic transformation, suggesting that rapid and accurate assessment of the collaterals would provide a powerful tool for treatment evaluation. The current gold standard for collateral scoring is performed by subjective analysis of retrograde filling in invasive digital subtraction angiograms (DSA). Though CTA is more limited than DSA in the direct evaluation of collaterals, the presence of collaterals may also be evaluated in CTA by the tree-pattern of vessel filling around the site of occlusion. Several manual assessment techniques based on CTA have been proposed in the literature, but all are subjective and require significant human intervention.  During Phase I, we deployed a web-based system for automated assessment of stroke collaterals based on CTA, and we used it in a preliminary study of collateral status for stroke assessment.  In this Phase II STTR proposal, the specific aims are (1) to improve the integration of our system with clinical workflows; (2) expand the system to also compute CT perfusion stroke measures, so as to provide a unified platform for comparing and combining CTA collateral and CT perfusion assessment metrics; and (3) test the hypotheses that the combined use of CTA collateral and CT perfusion measures outperforms either method independently for treatment efficacy prediction in stroke patients. Narrative  Leptomeningeal collateral vessels provide connections between vascular territories in the brain when occlusions occur, e.g., when a person suffers a stroke. The number and connectivity of collateral vessels varies significantly from patient to patient, and they have been shown to play an important role in stroke outcomes, providing blood flow to tissue at risk. Rapid and effective patient-specific determination of the presence and connectivity of collaterals is needed in acute stroke situations to determine which treatments will be effective. We propose to develop an automated system to evaluate collateral vessel trees from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images and to offer that system as an algorithms-as-a-service (AaaS) product.",Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms,9622038,R42NS086295,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Odds Ratio', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Triage', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'product development', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'statistics', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'thrombolysis', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'web services']",NINDS,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2018,489999,0.09622321149777148
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9430869,K02NS104207,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2017,208791,0.1585592947825885
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9365110,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,711929,0.12998536829435067
"A Functional Upper Limb Training and Assessment Tool to Enhance Efficacy and Scalability of Rehabilitation in Ecological Environments ABSTRACT Impairments following stroke make it one of the leading causes of disability. Many individuals with stroke do not recover complete function of the upper limb at time of discharge from clinical services . Moreover, early stage improvements may wane following the cessation of formal therapies. Regaining as much upper limb function as possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with limitations in daily function and lower health- related quality of life. Thus, finding ways to augment functional mobility is important. The overarching purpose of this project is to use portable technology, affordable for home use, to provide objective feedback on performance of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic conditions such as stroke. Objective feedback serves to better inform the participant of their progress and actively engage them in their rehabilitation, thus encouraging self-management of rehabilitation. Results from a recent survey shows therapists predominantly provide patients with stroke written home exercise programs at time of discharge from therapies. With this static approach, patients have a limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no encouragement to refine their movement. Creating automated systems that measure and provide feedback will promote a more proactive approach to maximizing function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. We propose that coupling smart technology found in readily available smartphones with three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a scalable option to provide feedback in long-term rehabilitation and advances the current standard of care, i.e. written home exercise programs. We will build upon our current research, further developing and validating a novel in-home rehabilitation system using 3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use emerging low- cost 3D printing techniques to augment off-the-shelf smart devices (e.g., smartphones) into functional rehabilitation tools. The built-in sensors and our machine learning apps in smartphones can quantify characteristics of movement and provide actionable feedbacks to users during in-home rehabilitation. We hypothesize that feedback will result in improved functional mobility. We will examine performance changes in common activities of daily living (ADLs) trained with our system. With the portable devices, we are able to go further than reporting the typical time metric and also provide feedback on smoothness of movement represented as a normalized cumulative jerk (rate of change of acceleration) score. This assessment provides information on control of movement, an indication of impairment. Recording normalized jerk over time and across activities is a promising way to assess change in impairment. Overall, this scalable design offers an innovative approach to long-term rehabilitation needs of individuals with stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions promoting optimum motor performance across the lifespan are a priority after a neurological insult such as stroke. The proposed research incorporates smart devices and 3D printing to create patient-centered rehabilitation devices that are scalable.

"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9315225,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biometry', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,296515,0.08630266963157843
"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9292814,K01HD091283,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Nature', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical Medicine', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wolves', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'computerized tools', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional improvement', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'muscle strength', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke treatment', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K01,2017,133191,0.14389970174246317
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9243329,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,569977,0.19926180271566085
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments.

"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,9395742,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,130225,0.09491092292943581
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9244766,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2017,2210408,0.0820734158659253
"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk. Evidence from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted suicide prevention efforts in general medical settings.",Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS),9228391,R01MH103539,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'case control', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'treatment duration', 'trend', 'virtual', 'years of life lost']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2017,633460,0.1121873038927512
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9448687,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,798921,0.07441957204224312
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9195060,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke survivor', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,722492,0.20018805815423135
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,9326960,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'language onset', 'language processing', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'perfusion imaging', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,419061,0.06806675244919402
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers. This research would lay down the groundwork for utilizing neuroimaging as an objective tool for stroke rehabilitation.",Stroke Plasticity,9242083,K23NS086852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Aging', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biofeedback', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Contralateral', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Robot', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vascular blood supply', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior test', 'brain computer interface', 'clinical application', 'constraint induced therapy', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'economic cost', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'stroke intervention', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2017,184656,0.16776347762759672
"Optimizing sensori-motor training post-stroke Project Summary The large variability in lesions, impairment, and responsiveness to training following stroke has hindered the development of principled and cost-effective approaches to neuro-rehabilitation of the upper extremity. Our long-term goal is to develop predictive personalized neurorehabilitation therapy based on large data sets. This proposal is based on a unique opportunity to design and execute a large neuro-rehabilitation cohort study at a relatively low cost. Building on our established US-French collaborations, with interdisciplinary expertise in neurorehabilitation, brain imaging, dynamical systems, and statistical learning, we will predict recovery and individualize therapy with the following novel three-pronged approach. In Aim 1, we will develop a database of clinical and neural patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes from 500 patients post-stroke receiving upper extremity rehabilitation therapy with the ARMEO Spring device (a gravity compensating exoskeleton) in routine clinical care. Inclusion criteria will be as broad as possible to include patients with a large variety of brain lesions, as assessed by state- of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI scans. In aim 2, using the database, we will predict long-term changes in upper extremity outcomes as a function of patient's characteristics and treatment using dynamical models that link motor learning to recovery. The final models will expand and combine previous computational models of motor learning at small time scales with models of recovery at long time scales, and will include mixed effects to accurately predict long-term recovery for individual patients. In aim 3, based on these predictions, we will perform a feasibility study aimed at individualizing upper extremity rehabilitation to maximize recovery. Given a new patient, characterized by a number of baseline characteristics that predict recovery, we will select the schedule of treatment that was the most effective for similar patients in the database. The recovery models and scheduling methods developed in this proposal will provide the basis for future clinical software that suggests timing, dosage, and content of therapy from early clinical data, kinematic performance, and routine scans. Such an approach will transform neurorehabilitation programs because the clinician, patient, and insurance company will be able to determine effective treatments while reducing costs. Inclusion of Children Children and adolescents under the age of 21 will be excluded on scientific grounds. The incidence, etiology and pathophysiology of stroke are quite different in this age range, and inclusion would introduce substantial heterogeneity to the subject pool without providing a large enough sample to inform pediatric stroke care. More importantly, patterns of recovery differ with age, and adding small numbers of subjects with very different recovery from the target population would similarly impede hypothesis testing.",Optimizing sensori-motor training post-stroke,9512137,R56NS100528,"['21 year old', 'Accounting', 'Action Research', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood stroke', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Force of Gravity', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Health Insurance', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Space Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Upper Extremity', 'acute stroke', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'exoskeleton', 'inclusion criteria', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'kinematics', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'treatment group']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R56,2017,483108,0.0796120023948585
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9465584,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'screening', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2017,303622,0.18534589562178053
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.        ",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9080772,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,321827,0.08630266963157843
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9115234,R01MH085651,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Butter', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral study', 'biological heterogeneity', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'geriatric depression', 'indexing', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,488490,0.10205920439147156
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9083041,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'wasting']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2016,2291632,0.0820734158659253
"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk. Evidence from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted suicide prevention efforts in general medical settings.",Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS),9033159,R01MH103539,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Planning', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'abstracting', 'case control', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population health', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'treatment duration', 'trend', 'virtual', 'years of life lost']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2016,605980,0.1121873038927512
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.                ",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9028400,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'abstracting', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke survivor', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,767518,0.20018805815423135
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,9059058,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Arteriogram', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavioral study', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,419061,0.06806675244919402
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia.

"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers. This research would lay down the groundwork for utilizing neuroimaging as an objective tool for stroke rehabilitation.",Stroke Plasticity,8989165,K23NS086852,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Aging', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biofeedback', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Contralateral', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Robot', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech Therapy', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vascular blood supply', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral plasticity', 'brain computer interface', 'clinical application', 'constraint induced therapy', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'economic cost', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'stroke intervention', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2016,186344,0.16776347762759672
"High Content Sceening for Hereditary Stroke Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a hereditary stroke syndrome that has no treatment other than neurosurgery. Loss of one of three genes causes CCM. By reducing the expression of one of these genes (CCM2) in the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells), unique structural and functional phenotypes result. We will use a chemical suppression screen in cell culture systems to discover small molecules that rescue these distinct phenotypes. Our high-throughput platform consists of two primary screens: the first is an imaging screen with machine-learning based phenotype analysis; the second screen uses electric cell substrate impedance sensing to detect changes in endothelial barrier function. We will then further screen the top candidate compounds in a mouse model of human CCM disease. The result of this project will be personalized medicine candidates for the treatment of CCM caused by mutations in the CCM2 gene.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,8914669,R01MH085651,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Butter', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral study', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'geriatric depression', 'indexing', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,490410,0.10205920439147156
"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk. Evidence from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted suicide prevention efforts in general medical settings.                ",Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS),8815759,R01MH103539,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Planning', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'abstracting', 'case control', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'treatment duration', 'trend', 'virtual', 'years of life lost']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2015,707635,0.1121873038927512
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,8851562,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Arteriogram', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasic', 'behavioral study', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language onset', 'language processing', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,428103,0.06806675244919402
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs.

Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.            ",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,8630165,R01MH085651,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Butter', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'aged', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'geriatric depression', 'indexing', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,496314,0.10205920439147156
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.            ",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,8758212,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Arteriogram', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasic', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language onset', 'language processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,445153,0.06806675244919402
"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery1-7. One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function1-7. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation. This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of  stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery. Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for  intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the  stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation.

"Biomarker panel to differentiate stroke from stroke mimic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States (US), stroke affects more than 700,000 people annually in the U.S. and is the third leading cause of death. Stroke patients may present to the emergency room with a wide variety of symptoms that can be caused by other conditions not related to stroke, collectively called stroke mimic. Even at the most advanced stroke centers, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is made by clinical examination after ruling out hemorrhagic lesions by imaging. These imaging tests can be used to diagnose hemorrhagic stroke but is relatively ineffective in detecting most ischemic stroke. A reliable and rapid method to distinguish stroke and stroke mimic is a necessary aid to current examination and imaging-based stroke diagnosis and will become more crucial with the implementation of new therapies for the time-critical treatment of ischemic stroke. In contrast to cardiovascular disease and oncology, no approved immunoassay or molecular test is available to aid diagnosis. Analysis of a previous dataset demonstrated that our advanced GeneRx algorithm technologies were able to develop an accurate diagnostic model where other multi-marker panels failed. In this phase I proposal we will perform a validation study, collecting blood samples from 200 admitted with stroke-like symptoms and diagnosed as stroke or stroke mimic. We will measure stroke biomarker protein levels markers present in the top combinations and algorithms from our previous study, and utilize our proprietary GeneRx technology to develop a multiple marker predictive model for accurate differentiation of stroke from stroke mimic. Project Narrative: Currently no blood test is available to help accurately diagnose stroke patients. This study develops a diagnostic to help differentiate stroke patients from the many non-stroke patients that arrive at the ER with stroke-like symptoms. Successful development of this diagnostic will increase the effectiveness and speed of stroke treatment to increase a patient's chances of improvement and safety of treatment.          n/a",Biomarker panel to differentiate stroke from stroke mimic,7405215,R43NS061455,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Condition', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunoassay', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'social', 'statistics', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2008,252533,0.210626480857234
"Statistical Methods for Predicting Suicide Attempt    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with the goal of supporting the development of the applicant's career as a quantitative researcher in psychiatry. The training and research plan is intended to build on the candidate's prior work in the statistical analysis of clinical, biological and gene expression data on mood disorders. The application delineates plans for training and mentoring in the areas of biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical diagnoses and neurobiology of depression, and genomic analysis necessary to enable the applicant to pursue an independent career of scientific inquiry in psychiatric statistics. These goals will be met by a combination of supervision and didactic course work in the Division of Neuroscience of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University. The aim of the Research Plan is to develop and evaluate efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of suicide attempts and completed suicides in patients with mood disorders. For the purposes of this study, suicide attempt will be defined as a self-destructive act with at least some intent to end one's life. The focus will be on developing and evaluating predictive models based on a large number of retrospective and longitudinal measurements on each subject, as opposed to identification of individual risk factors. Aim 1 proposes to build/evaluate classification models for suicide attempters/nonattempters based on complete data. Aim 2 will build/evaluate survival analysis models when some of the subjects have censored data. Aim 3 will concentrate on classification of post-mortem brain samples from suicide victims and normal controls as a method of identifying putative risk factors for suicidal behavior. This will include large-scale gene expression analysis as well as the analysis of receptor bindings and other biochemical information in suicide victims and normal controls.

"c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently there is only one approved drug treatment for acute ischemic stroke, t-PA. t-PA is a highly beneficial treatment but is severely underutilized due largely to fear of an often fatal side effect called hemorrhagic transformation. There is a critical clinical need for a diagnostic to identify patients that are at high and low risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT). A preliminary study showed that plasma level of cellular fibronectin (c-Fn) was predictive of t-PA induced HT. We will collect patient samples and perform a validation study to confirm the utility of c-Fn as a molecular diagnostic for the prediction of more severe forms of HT. In this study we will determine the threshold levels of c-Fn that are most predictive of outcome, determine if the elevation of c-Fn is time dependant, and follow c-Fn levels through treatment. In addition we will analyze additional plasma biomarkers, matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-C), and serum amyloid A (SAA) as potential contributors to c-Fn to more accurately predict HT. A successful diagnostic would greatly improve safety and increase use of t-PA/thrombolytics in the treatment of stroke. This validation study develops the first biomarker-based diagnostic to aid physicians in the identification of patients with high and low risk of bleeding as a result of clot busting treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Successful development will increase safety and usage of this highly beneficial treatment as well as lower overall healthcare cost as a result of stroke.          n/a",c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients,7220477,R43NS057921,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Americas', 'Apolipoproteins C', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Clot', 'Blood coagulation', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Economic Burden', 'Elevation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evolution', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fibronectins', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Metalloproteases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological reperfusion', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistically Significant', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Vascular blood supply', 'apolipoprotein C-III', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'desire', 'disability', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'point of care', 'prognostic', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2007,206191,0.09525651861936786
"Robotic Stroke Rehabilitation Using Perceptual Feedback    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to advances in modern medicine, the elderly population is growing worldwide, and, along with this growth, there is a growing need for physical rehabilitation after strokes, which have an average onset of over 65 years of age. Given the magnitude of this problem and its societal ramifications, the time is ripe to explore the extent to which robotic devices and virtual environments can be used as a means of rehabilitation to improve the quality of life for both the elderly and the physically disabled. According to recent studies in robotics, robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation enhances arm movement recovery. Moreover, robot-assisted rehabilitation improves patients' mobility and strength to the point where it is equal to, or greater than, that which is achieved by human-assisted therapy. However, none of the currently available systems addresses patients' perceptual or cognitive deficits. Furthermore, these systems neglect to address the fact that many patients do not reach their full mobility potential using these systems. To remedy these problems, a virtual robotic environment that explores the full potential needs and abilities of patients must be developed. We will coin this strategy, ""rehabilitation by distortion."" To develop an environment to rehabilitate by distortion, however, there are two fundamental issues to address. First, it is necessary to quantify the perceptual gap that can be created between virtual and actual movements that is not perceptible to patients. To do so, we will first quantify the lowest sensory resolution, also known as just noticeable difference (JND), of force and position. As we explain below, the JND will act as the lowest bound of the perceptual gap. In addition, we will quantify the size of the perceptual gap with the existence of visual feedback distortion. Second, having identified a perceptual gap that is not noticeable, we must prove that mobility and strength of stroke patients can be extended by undetected distortion. For this proposed work, we will isolate working with one finger. Fingers are one of the parts of the body that are most commonly affected by strokes; thus testing the basic concepts about the perceptual gap between virtual and actual movements using fingers is appropriate. After we prove that rehabilitation by distortion is therapeutic for a finger, we can expand our work to other limbs. In addition, to show that this strategy is effective for patients who already received traditional therapy, we will work with patients who have already completed their traditional therapy and are at least one year after the onset of strokes. If we prove that we can allow patients to move beyond what they thought was possible after traditional therapeutic techniques, the results will be groundbreaking and will lead to an R01 grant to develop a new robotic virtual therapeutic strategy, ""rehabilitation by distortion,"" that extends the force production and range of motion for motor impaired patients recovering from stroke.         n/a",Robotic Stroke Rehabilitation Using Perceptual Feedback,7031314,R21HD047405,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomechanics', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer simulation', 'fingers', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'longitudinal human study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'motion perception', 'patient oriented research', 'perceptual distortions', 'quality of life', 'rehabilitation', 'robotics', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory thresholds', 'stroke therapy']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2006,157321,0.06058932439763692
"MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE As stroke therapies emerge, they will likely work better if given earlier after stroke onset.  This Patient-oriented Research Career Development Award proposal involves the design, implementation and validation of a prehospital stroke scale, the Medic One Stroke Scale (MOSS), with Dr. David Tirschwell as the principal investigator.  Dr. Tirschwell is a neurologist completing a Master's degree in epidemiology at the University of Washington and plans a career as a stroke clinical researcher and epidemiologist.

"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,9973232,K23MH118361,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alaska', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empathy', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Idaho', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Montana', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Partnership Practice', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Trauma Nursing', 'Trauma patient', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Wyoming', 'acute care', 'base', 'care providers', 'college', 'computerized', 'coping', 'evidence base', 'feasibility trial', 'health care settings', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevention clinical trial', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'responsible research conduct', 'safety net', 'screening', 'severe injury', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'task analysis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'trauma units', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2020,154553,0.07622509107002416
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9999028,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2020,50016,0.09363410316440551
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9910447,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,721582,0.07024724123789454
"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts.

"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data Summary. Suicide in youths is a growing health concern, yet current clinical practice falls short of timely identifying youths at risk for suicide attempt (SA). The overarching aim of this research is to use data driven machine learning methods to facilitate primary prevention of youth SAs in primary care pediatric settings. Clinical guidelines recommend screening for depression, considered a proxy for suicide risk, from age 12 in pediatric setting. The proposed study aims at identification of variables (features) that can be collected by early adolescence, and contribute to prediction of SA in later adolescence. This study will leverage the effort that has been invested in previous projects: a study using electronic health records (EHR) to predict SAs and deaths in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) hospitals; and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that included comprehensive phenotyping of ~9,500 youths. These previous efforts will be integrated to develop and optimize SA prediction in youth from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) network, from which we have data on ~40,000 who were screened for a history of SA between the years 2014-2018 (n~1500). First, in the CHOP dataset, we will generate predictive models based on UPMC data, test their predictive validity in CHOP youth population, and then develop, optimize, and cross validate these predictive models using CHOP EHR data as a training set (Aim 1). Second, in the PNC dataset, we will use multiple data types (demographic, behavioral, cognitive, imaging) to classify youths with suicide ideation (SI, n~750) and identify features (potentially modifiable) that are indicative of SI and may also point to potential mechanisms underlying youth SI (Aim 2). Lastly, in a subset of 936 youths (49 with SAs) with both CHOP EHR data and research PNC evaluation that was conducted at mean age 11 (T1), ~5 years before SA screening (T2), we will test the validity of models from Aims 1&2, and aim to identify data features that were collected at T1 and can improve/optimize/outperform the prediction of SAs that relies solely on EHR data (Aim 3). The proposed study relies on the expertise of a highly capable multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Barzilay (PI), child- adolescent psychiatrist experienced in suicide research and analysis of suicide related phenotypes in PNC data; Dr. Tsui (PI), an expert in machine learning who has developed predictive algorithms of SA and deaths using UPMC data; and collaborators critical for meeting study aims, Dr. Raquel Gur as the lead researcher who established the PNC, Dr. Ruben Gur who developed the PNC neurocognitive assessment tools, and Dr. Oquendo who will provide expertise in suicide prediction research. The team’s access and familiarity with CHOP EHR and PNC data resources, coupled with its interdisciplinary expertise, creates a unique opportunity to identify childhood features that can optimize later adolescent SA prediction. Expected findings can ultimately translate to real world clinical practice, be integrated in EHR, and help flag youths at risk for a SA in a pediatric setting, allowing timely identification and intervention, contributing to the mission of reducing suicide in youth. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth, and a major focus of pediatric and psychiatric research, yet teen suicide rates are on the rise. The proposed research aims to develop novel computational tools that will allow prediction of youth suicide attempts using the individual’s electronic medical record, and help identify which variables (that are currently not part of the medical record) need to be integrated in the medical record of a child in order to optimize such prediction. The findings of this project are expected to translate to clinical practice and help primary care providers timely identify youth at suicide risk and thus contribute to reducing youth suicide rates.","Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data",10038009,R21MH123916,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Gur', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pediatric patients', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'reducing suicide', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'social cognition', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,498803,0.07247305745983319
"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease.

"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9930662,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'feature extraction', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'multiple datasets', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,504970,0.09656131539642428
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,9983838,K08NS109315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Writing', 'brain behavior', 'brain cell', 'career', 'career development', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'disability', 'disability burden', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'meetings', 'motor behavior', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'nervous system disorder', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation research', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory cortex', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,213840,0.09014364885427911
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,9939641,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,681289,0.025235270513880543
"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,9859704,R01MH121455,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family Study', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'structured data', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'trait']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,561236,0.09923815580563676
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia ABSTRACT: Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research  Suicide is among the top leading causes of death in the US; individuals with schizophrenia (Sz) have a lifetime risk of more than tenfold that of the general population. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) are prevalent also in clinical risk states for schizophrenia, in teens and young adults at increased clinical high risk (CHR) for Sz and related psychotic disorders, based on attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS). In CHR cohorts, lifetime prevalence is ~77% for suicidal ideation and ~20% for suicidal behavior and attempts. Base rates for suicide by death after ascertainment is ~1% within a few years. Despite the clear public health problem of SIB in CHR teens and young adults, there is a clear gap in our understanding of their associated mechanisms and neural substrates, and their demographic, symptom and clinical correlates. It is important to gain a better understanding of SIB in CHR individuals in order to extend prevention efforts for CHR individuals beyond prevention of psychosis and poor functional outcome to include suicide prevention as well.  This proposal is an administrative supplement submitted in response to NOT-MH-19-026 Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research, for the parent R01 of “Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia” (end 2021). It capitalizes on the parent R01's prospective cohort that includes data across multiple levels of analysis, including behavior (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuits (brain structure and function), as well as data on SIB collected for purposes of safety, using the PhenX toolkit measure of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Therefore, this supplement does not entail the addition of any new measures. It is expected there will be data on 90 CHR, 25 Sz, and 25 healthy individuals by mid-2020 amenable for analysis (preliminary data now includes 30 CHR).  This supplement adds a new specific aim relevant to suicide risk, namely to identify linguistic/cognitive biomarkers, symptom/demographic correlates and neural substrates of C-SSRS SIB in CHR individuals using advanced analytic methods, including natural language processing, machine learning, penalized regression, and sparse modeling. The work proposed is within the scope of the parent R01 as it entails the application of similar advanced analytic methods to the same dataset, to understand mechanisms of key clinical features in a young at-risk cohort (parent R01: psychosis risk: supplement: suicide risk). It is hypothesized that SIB will be associated in CHR individuals with greater use of words with negative emotional content and greater self-focus in language (use of personal pronouns), social cognitive deficits, depression, motivational deficits, gray matter reduction and abnormal resting connectivity. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) is prevalent in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, including during putative prodromal stages, in teens and young adults at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis; however, little is known about the mechanisms and neural substrates that underlie SIB in at-risk youths. This proposal for an administrative supplement capitalizes on a large prospective CHR cohort study that has data available across behavioral (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuit-based (brain structure and function) levels, as well as safety data on SIB from a measure in the PhenX toolkit. It employs advanced analytic methods and automated language analysis to gain a better understanding of SIB in psychosis risk states, key for development of suicide prevention efforts in this risk group of young people.",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9941435,R01MH107558,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Face', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'lifetime risk', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,150193,0.05355666227700939
"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success because of a number of important advantages over the designs used in previous studies.",Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors,9863809,R01MH121478,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Decision Making', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Employment', 'Equilibrium', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Link', 'Marital Status', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Probability', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'accomplished suicide', 'base', 'care providers', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical practice', 'collaborative care', 'common treatment', 'comparative treatment', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'reducing suicide', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicide rate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment planning', 'treatment trial', 'virtual']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,842134,0.07860733968537417
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9931326,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,520509,0.12998536829435067
"Using claims data to study the association between Alzheimer's disease and suicidal behaviors PROJECT ABSTRACT Given that dementia represents the major cause of loss of autonomy in older adults, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (ADRD) could represent a critical moment that increases the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA). However, despite significant research progress in the past decade, it remains unclear if there are “clusters” of patients with ADRD who are at an increased risk for suicide, and how utilization of healthcare services, or the lack thereof, might be associated with SI/SA rates. This supplement will use large-scale commercial health insurance claims data and advanced machine learning algorithms to study these questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes.

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington.

"Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs, and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices. These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This project aims to bridge the gap between assistive devices and rehabilitative tools so that stroke patients with a paretic arm can immediately return to their daily routine and use their activities of daily living as a patient-specific rehabilitation strategy. Assistive bionic exoskeletons will be intuitively controlled with residual muscle activity from the paretic arm, and artificial intelligence will elucidate underlying muscle impairment, improve the dexterity of bionic devices, and temporarily assist and rehabilitate stroke patients. This proposal is relevant to NIH’s mission because it has strong potential to improve quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers, as well as reduce overall healthcare costs.",Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography,10017601,DP5OD029571,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Bionics', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Electromyography', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'HRK gene', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Human Subject Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Spasticity', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Paresis', 'Patients', 'Physical Medicine', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Residual state', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'arm paresis', 'career', 'career development', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'exoskeleton', 'faculty mentor', 'functional restoration', 'graduate student', 'handbook', 'hemiparetic stroke', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lecturer', 'muscle strength', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'patient oriented', 'post stroke', 'professor', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'social', 'strength training', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'upper limb hemiparesis', 'visual feedback']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,DP5,2020,327384,0.14669283437143846
"Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores ABSTRACT Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero. From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year). Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide. Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue” cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention. Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome- wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the PsychEMERGE consortium. NARRATIVE We will develop and validate models to predict suicide death, as distinct from suicide attempt, using electronic health records (EHR), demographics, environmental stresses, familial risks, and genetic differences. We will use 9,000 Utah suicides with longitudinal EHR data (>5,000 of these with molecular data growing to 10,000 by the end of the study), Utah population controls, collaborations with Mount Sinai Medical School and Vanderbilt University, and validation/replication with the large EHR and molecular data resources in the PsychEMERGE Consortium.",Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores,10027263,R01MH123489,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical Examiners', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'early life stress', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'model development', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,738338,0.11539007449626426
"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia.",Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke,9818821,R01DC013270,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,564226,-0.013602955771080753
"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,10003830,F31MH120973,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fellowship', 'Foster Home Care', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Workers', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abuse neglect', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'child protective service', 'cohort', 'experience', 'foster care', 'health service use', 'high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'opioid epidemic', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'response', 'service intervention', 'stem', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.08676805692214277
"Data Harmonization PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25 years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups” and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of existing scales”. We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built based on Amazon Web Services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke prevention guidelines state that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” We propose to address this gap by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. We will extend the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to develop and validate new risk prediction models for stroke and compare their performance to existing and simpler tools.",Data Harmonization,10129688,R61NS120246,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Guidelines', 'Hemorrhage', 'Individual', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data exchange', 'data harmonization', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'offspring', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'web services']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R61,2020,706014,0.1472595072027283
"Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Similar trends exist in the U.S., where it is estimated that every 40 seconds a stroke occurs, leading to a stroke-related death every 4 minutes. Afflicting approximately 800,000 Americans each year, time sensitive and widely practicable diagnostic algorithms are paramount. Despite increasing emphasis on the significance of blood flow characteristics in pursuing strokes, estimating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) inside the skull is no trivial task. Imaging techniques that provide rCBF distribution may be unavailable due to time constraint or access to facilities, or simply the expenses attached to it. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a model that can give blood flow estimates in real-time for the entire brain vasculature. Here, we propose a novel hybrid computational model that utilizes high-performance computing and machine learning to simulate the entire brain vasculature, as well as provide real time measures of regional CBF. We will use novel mathematical methods to determine the vascular geometry of each subject using our existing imaging database that includes CTA and CBF images from stroke patients, and will subsequently validate our simulations against the same dataset. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to extract patterns in stroke patients' blood flow and give estimates for stroke severity predictors on patient- specific measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this project is to estimate blood flow properties in the brain and its correlation with stroke. We will simulate and validate a model to give similar information as the expensive perfusion scanning measurements. Through Machine Learning algorithms, we will provide severity estimates for stroke patients for more informed clinical decisions and better patient care.",Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment,9898495,R03NS108167,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cerebrum', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Gaussian model', 'Geometry', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical translation', 'cranium', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'perfusion imaging', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'tool', 'trend']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2020,78898,0.1286251427821164
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9973097,K02NS104207,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'response', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke model', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2020,224790,0.1585592947825885
"The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross- sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn, contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone technology to assess SMU using real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk (Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively- monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent suicide and suicidality have increased in recent years, which parallels the advent and rapid growth of social media use in adolescents’ daily lives. The proposed study will be the first in a broader program of research that leverages smartphone technology to examine how social media use impacts risk for the development and worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents. This research program aims to identify modifiable risk factors, including social media use and sleep disruption, for adolescent suicide risk, and ultimately, contribute to the development of interventions that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time to prevent suicide.",The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study,10054721,K01MH121584,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Attenuated', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Environment', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Interview', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Environment', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'adolescent suicide', 'boys', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinically actionable', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'girls', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid growth', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'sleep onset', 'social', 'social media', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,58402,-0.041457417513747805
"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9888377,K01HD091283,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical Medicine', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wolves', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'computerized tools', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional improvement', 'heterogenous data', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'muscle strength', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'rehabilitation research', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K01,2020,133191,0.14389970174246317
"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke. This will facilitate important recovery research that is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability. The quantitative methodology will advance data-driven discovery in the presence of nuisance variables, which is relevant to biomedical research applications such as diagnostics, genetics, and imaging.",Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha   ,9978948,R01LM013316,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'network models', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'wearable device']",NLM,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,300000,0.14142300488872384
"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,9932520,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Expression Profiling', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'rare genetic disorder', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular risk factor', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,122618,0.09491092292943581
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",9902563,R01NS110779,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Aminocaproic Acids', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents', 'Aspirin', 'Blood Coagulation Factor VII', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Desmopressin', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Factor VIIa', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hypomagnesemia', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Texas', 'Thrombelastography', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain tissue', 'clopidogrel', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metropolitan', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'stroke trials', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,613310,0.048971029205953476
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9901631,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,720691,0.06131196809976856
"Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse (or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed and evaluate the accuracy of a novel pH MRI technique for identifying stroke patients with salvageable brain regions, as well as patients at increased risk for developing hemorrhage after an acute ischemic stroke. The results would enhance patient selection for treatment, extend the therapeutic time window, and improve the risk-benefit ratio of recanalization therapies.",Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,9968624,R01NS112242,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Acute', 'Alteplase', 'Amides', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Penumbra', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombectomy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'human imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'predict clinical outcome', 'radio frequency', 'risk benefit ratio', 'standard care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombolysis', 'time use', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384813,0.06230082439625544
"Closed loop synchrony stimulation for motor recovery after chronic stroke PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a common cause of disability, with the majority of stroke patients exhibiting chronic motor impairments. A commonly observed pattern of impairment is fragmented movement control (i.e. loss of smooth transitions during movements) and difficulty with sequences, even with physical rehabilitation therapy. We have poor understanding as to the neural circuit basis of these impairments. Current efforts in neuromodulation for motor recovery have resulted in variable effects, potentially due to nonspecific targeting of modulation. Work by Dr. Karunesh Ganguly's group, conducted in rats, has demonstrated that there is a characteristic low frequency [1.5-5Hz] quasi-oscillatory activity in low frequency local field potential (LFP) that occurs during a skilled reaching task in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS). This phenomenon occurs when a group of neurons (ensemble) in each region fires in a synchronous manner, time-locked to the reach-to-grasp motion. In animals that have motor deficits due to stroke in M1, premotor cortex (M2) rearranges to recapitulate forelimb behavior representations that were lost; M2 is also connected to DLS. Additionally, electrical stimulation delivered therapeutically to M2 at the expected time onset of low frequency LFP power quasi-oscillations can improve accuracy in a skilled reaching task, but animals still display fragmented movement control – characterized by a loss of smoothness that is present in both human stroke subjects and animal models. The central hypothesis is that similar to how coordinated LFP and ensemble spiking activity is a marker of M1-DLS coordination, increasing neural synchrony between M2 and DLS will result in increased recovery of skilled motor function after M1 stroke. In both aims, motor function will be assessed in rats with a reaching task to retrieve pellets. Behavioral outcomes such as reach time, kinematic trajectory, amplitude (distance paw traveled in a single reach), and successful retrieval will be assessed. In this proposal, my first aim is to characterize how coordinated neural activity in M2 and DLS evolves with recovery. In the second aim, I will assess how M2 ensemble spiking-dependent stimulation of DLS affects performance of the reach to grasp task in stroke animals with chronic motor deficits. In addition to my mentor's expertise on stroke rehabilitation, treatments, and neural interfaces, guidance from my thesis committee members Dr. Philip Starr (neurosurgery, deep brain stimulation, closed-loop stimulation) and Professor Michel Maharbiz (recording and stimulation electrode paradigms) support the feasibility of this study. We predict that increasing synchronizing M2-DLS activity post-stroke using population spike timing-dependent plasticity principles will improve behavioral outcomes after a chronic stroke plateau: reach time will decreased to baseline; reach trajectory will be smoother and more stereotyped, as assessed by a deep learning method that automatically captures movement parameters; and accuracy of obtaining pellets will increase. By accomplishing these aims, I will contribute to knowledge of how cortico-striatal connections play a role in motor recovery after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a common cause of disability, resulting in many motor deficits such as poor coordination and smooth velocity regulation despite extensive physical rehabilitation, with little understanding of the neural circuit basis for these impairments. After primary motor cortex (M1) stroke, the perilesional premotor cortex (M2) rearranges to recapture movement representations that were lost, and both regions have monosynaptic projections to a deep brain structure in the striatum, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in rodents. This work will characterize the how M2 and DLS neural activity simultaneously evolve with stroke recovery, as well as assess whether closed- loop M2 ensemble spiking-dependent electrical stimulation of DLS will improve motor function after chronic stroke.",Closed loop synchrony stimulation for motor recovery after chronic stroke,10140813,F31NS117010,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Committee Members', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dependence', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fire - disasters', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Stereotyping', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Virus', 'Work', 'activity marker', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chronic stroke', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'grasp', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'motor deficit', 'motor function improvement', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'post intervention', 'post stroke', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stereotypy', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2020,37672,0.09756428086769216
"Plasma MicroRNA Biomarkers to Guide Rehabilitation Therapy After Stroke Abstract Following a stroke, each patient has a specific capacity to recover function that likely hinges on their ability to mount a neural repair response. Knowing this capacity early on would provide opportunities for personalized medicine in stroke rehabilitation. Physicians and therapists currently have few methods to predict recovery, and therefore have little data to guide decisions on treatment approach and length of stay. This has led to suboptimal therapy delivery. There is, however, emerging evidence to suggest that biomarkers can accurately predict recovery potential in order to guide therapy. Early attempts to improve motor recovery prediction used clinical, neurophysiologic (TMS), and MRI biomarkers to develop algorithms with up to 80% accuracy. While these are helpful, they tell us little about the biology of stroke recovery and are difficult to implement in most rehabilitation facilities. We recently identified a panel of 5 microRNAs (miRNAs) collected from plasma on rehab admission that can predict motor recovery with 95% accuracy. These 5 miRNAs converge on axonal guidance and developmental biology pathways. We therefore suspect that they capture the potential to mount a neural repair response after stroke. The overall goal of the proposal is to refine this miRNA predictive panel using a larger number of samples from 3 studies, test it’s predictive / analytic qualities, and validate the predictive panel in a large prospective study. R61 Phase Specific Aims: Aim #1a. Analyze stroke samples from 3 independent studies and matched controls using discovery-based qRT-PCR. Aim #1b. Use machine learning to develop a miRNA panel with ≥ 80% predictive ability across the 3 studies to identify patients who achieve excellent, moderate, and poor motor recovery by 3-12 months, controlling for covariates. Aim #1c. Develop custom qRT-PCR cards that include ~10 miRNAs in the refined panel in triplicate along with endogenous controls. Perform analytic validation to gauge precision, accuracy, and ideal handling / storage. R33 Phase Specific Aims: Aim #2a. Prospectively validate the miRNA panel by collecting samples from patients with upper limb impairment admitted to 2 inpatient rehab facilities, testing sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive value for classifying excellent, moderate, and poor motor recovery at 6 months. Aim #2b Give the predicted recovery potential score to the treatment team upon patient discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation facility. Use regression and chi-squared tests to assess how having this information on the day of admission would have changed percent of time delivering specific therapies and recommended length of stay. Tailoring rehabilitation treatment to the individual’s biological capacity to recover may lead to greater independence and lower costs. Specifically, evidence suggests that delivering more restorative-type therapy to the subset of patients most likely to respond improves motor outcomes. Just as important, the miRNAs identified in the panel will become treatment targets for recovery-based therapeutics. Project Narrative This project will use qRT-PCR to analyze plasma samples collected from stroke patients to develop a microRNA-based motor recovery potential score. This score will undergo clinical validation as a tool to tailor rehabilitation therapy delivery for individual stroke patients at inpatient rehabilitation facilities based on their predicted level of motor recovery. Once validated, the score will be used in future studies to streamline therapy delivery and improve outcomes.",Plasma MicroRNA Biomarkers to Guide Rehabilitation Therapy After Stroke,10008023,R61NS117196,"['Admission activity', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'arm', 'axon guidance', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'precision medicine', 'predictive panel', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'response', 'restoration', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R61,2020,969858,0.11543180820992477
"Positive and Negative Valence Systems Underlying Suicide in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a major public health concern in adolescents and the second leading cause of death in this age group, highlighting the need to investigate suicide in adolescents. The two most prominent risk factors for completed suicide in youth are a past suicide attempt and a diagnosis of a depressive episode, each independently representing a 10- to 30-fold increased risk for completed suicide. However, while over 80% of suicidal youth present with depressive symptoms at the time of the attempt, only 30% of depressed youth will ever attempt suicide. These data suggest that depressed adolescents with prior suicide attempts represent a distinct neurobiological subgroup. However, at present, we have no biomarkers to identify those depressed youth who will engage in suicidal behavior. This proposal addresses this concern. Our proposed model is: (1) anhedonia is associated with heightened suicidal risk in depressed youth; (2) both positive valence (PVS) deficits (reward expectancy, attainment, positive prediction error) and negative valence (NVS) hyperactivity (negative prediction error, pain avoidance) contribute to anhedonia and underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth; (3) the habenula (Hb), a small limbic hub, plays a key role in PVS/NVS processes by inhibiting reward signaling in response to pain and loss; and (4) recent advances in high-resolution MRI address prior technical constraints in studying small structures such as the Hb. These advances now allow us to study the neuronal circuitry underlying PVS and NVS in a neuroanatomically rigorous framework. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia, not irritability, was associated with suicidality among depressed youth. Similarly, we found that both anhedonia and entrapment were independently associated with suicidality in acutely suicidal hospitalized individuals. We also developed the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks and identified brain function during reward anticipation, attainment, and positive and negative prediction errors. Notably, both RPET and a thermal pain task elicited measurable Hb activation. Additionally, utilizing an optimized segmentation and seeding approach, we mapped Hb intrinsic functional connectivity in adults and in adolescents with psychiatric symptoms. Building upon our work, we propose a tightly integrative study to test the overall hypothesis that both PVS deficiency and NVS hyperactivity underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth. We will study 30 suicidal and 30 non-suicidal depressed adolescents, ages 12-17, group matched for age, sex, and handedness. All will have comprehensive clinical evaluations (diagnoses, behavioral measures, computerized reward task). Neuroimaging studies will include structural MRI, resting-state and task fMRI (RFT, RPET, thermal pain). Machine learning algorithms will be used to examine which PVS/NVS processes predict suicidal behavior in depressed youth.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to suicide in adolescent depression, the cohort with the highest suicidal risk in youth. Using novel neuroimaging and modelling approaches, we will test the overall hypothesis that neural processes underlying both positive valence deficiency and negative valance hyperactivity play a key role in suicidal behavior in adolescent depression.

"Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform Project Summary / Abstract  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.  Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.  This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.  To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.  We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. It is clinically important that stroke survivors continue to practice the use of the stroke-affected limb in their home and community settings to maintain the functional level learned in the clinic, but currently, there exists no effective, practical clinical tool. In this project, we propose to develop and validate an mHealth technology that will monitor real-world upper limb activity by leveraging our novel finger-worn accelerometer sensors and provide individually-tailored feedback to encourage affected limb use.",Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform,9887267,R01EB027777,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Brachial Paresis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Upper Extremity', 'Upper limb movement', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'chronic stroke', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'functional disability', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'personalized management', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'upper limb hemiparesis', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'web platform']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,537650,0.14709478004500331
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke.

"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility",10026456,R44HL145826,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteriogram', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stroke', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'base', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebral vein', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NHLBI,"MAGNETIC RESONANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2020,667050,0.012651374737324136
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9889924,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2020,2187036,0.10697228809311365
"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,9844975,R01MH115922,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'Violence', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'individual response', 'men', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'physical abuse', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'respiratory', 'response', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,702056,0.10971006845830629
"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),9897457,R01AG062770,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Aspirin', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Coagulation Process', 'Community Practice', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'European', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clopidogrel', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'preference', 'prevent', 'safety outcomes', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,515169,0.11173365810274748
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors. Findings will inform short-term suicide risk prediction and the development of novel just-in-time interventions for individuals at high risk of suicide.",Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction,9981035,K23MH120436,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Agitation', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consensus', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guide prevention', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'demographics', 'diaries', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'standard measure', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,198877,0.12327097646309684
"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10055559,K01MH121580,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurons', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'accomplished suicide', 'bead chip', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomarker identification', 'biosignature', 'bisulfite', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'methylation biomarker', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'peripheral blood', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'prophylactic', 'pyrosequencing', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational study']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2020,174843,0.005912472301472004

About 40% of patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion. Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near- infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke. Narrative Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and this research proposal addresses the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disability. Current stroke treatments are primarily aimed at treating blockage of blood vessels but are only partially effective, leaving a great need for additional adjunctive therapies. Effective blood pressure management tailored to individual patients, with the aim of maintaining optimal brain blood flow, may prevent additional brain injury, and is an important first-step towards personalized medicine in stroke.",Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements,9977426,K23NS110980,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Edema', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hemorrhage', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Step Tests', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombectomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'career', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical center', 'clinical investigation', 'computerized data processing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'functional outcomes', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research clinical testing', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stroke therapy', 'therapeutic effectiveness', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,191533,0.05808110207575973
"Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation The 2019 U.S. practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivarox- aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second- ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char- acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out- comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over- all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ- ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy- pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu- nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to help guide personalized anticoagulant therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based anticoagulant therapy for secondary pre- vention in older ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. It is relevant to public health because the devel- opment and adoption of personalized evidence-based anticoagulant therapy are expected to reduce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation,10051556,R01AG066672,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Community Practice', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Embolism', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Renal clearance function', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Seminal', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Warfarin', 'Weight', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disability', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'preference', 'prevent', 'relative effectiveness', 'risk benefit ratio', 'safety outcomes', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,576918,0.12759516654344996
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9982129,U01MH116923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Geography', 'High School Student', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Music', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Value', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'bullying', 'clinical care', 'diaries', 'emotional distress', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'longitudinal design', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social deficits', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,U01,2020,714133,0.07779105213806531
"Development and Acceptability of an Ambient In-Home Activity Assessment Tool for Stroke 1. Project Summary/Abstract  Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not exercise or engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. One-on- one rehabilitation sessions are frequently limited in number due to insurance regulations and therapists (physical and occupational) frequently prescribe home-based exercise programs. These programs historically have low adherence rates and patient report can often be biased, incomplete, or inaccurate. Wearable sensors can track amount of activity but these sensors are limited in scope and cannot discern between various activities. Depth sensors can be used in the home to detect falls and monitor in-home gait patterns of well older adults. Other researchers have used depth sensors to detect and discern activities in laboratories or mock home environments with a population without any disabilities. In this proposal, the Daily Activity Recognition and Assessment System (DARAS) will merge prior ambient depth sensor work with newly developed algorithms to objectively and accurately measure the amount and type of activity of people with stroke living at home. This will be completed in three specific aims. The DARAS algorithms will be developed and refined for recognizing activities of people with stroke in the kitchen environment using the Foresite depth sensor. These algorithms will be trained using real-world data from lab-based testing with individuals with stroke (n =10). We will refine the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based algorithm for accurately segmenting and recognizing activities from untrimmed processing of depth videos. The developed activity recognition system will be deployed in the homes of 10 individuals with stroke over the course of 1 year. To determine the impact on daily life and acceptability of the system and generated data, focus groups will be held with 10 individuals with stroke. The DARAS developed in this proposal will provide a novel outcome assessment for a variety of post-stroke interventions and provide occupational therapists the ability to detect declines in performance early on and intervene. 8. Project Narrative Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a second stroke. Self-monitoring and self-report of home-based activity and exercise is highly subjective and provides little value to rehabilitation clinicians and their clients with stroke.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.

"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW. The study aims to achieve a number of outcomes: (1) Acquire refreshed data from all existing MSDW data sources; (2) Use the wide array of data sources stored in MSDW to advance the prediction of suicide mortality, while controlling for data quality and potential model bias; (3) Explore various uses cases of the MSDW such as unsupervised clustering of suicide mortality cases; and, (4) Collaborate with external investigators to validate the MSDW-derived predictive models of suicide death. ❖ PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge.

"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9939297,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Movement', 'Nervous system structure', 'Paresis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Step training', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'foot', 'functional independence', 'gait rehabilitation', 'hemiparesis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'locomotor control', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'social stigma', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'treadmill', 'treadmill training', 'visual feedback', 'walking speed']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,380769,0.12752937724472702
"Prehospital Diagnostic Biomarker for Large Vessel Occlusion Background: The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death. Although interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) treatments exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), their use is limited due to the short time window from symptom onset that these treatments are indicated to be administered in. Moreover, recent estimates suggest only approximately 10% of eligible patients receive interventional treatment which has shown to lead to better outcomes in several worldwide RCTs. In order for intervention to be successful, a standardized, quantitative, field based (pre- hospital) diagnostic tool is needed to improve LVO identification and ensure rapid transfer to a capable medical facility. Currently, the gold standard for stroke diagnosis is CT angiogram (CTA) which is limited to in-hospital use or a low number of mobile stroke ambulances, all costing multi-millions of dollars, requiring expert operators and IV injection of iodine-rich contrast material. Additionally, the clinical stroke assessment scales (RACE, LAMS, CPSS) used in the field although low cost and non-invasive have proven unreliable due to training requirements and low inherent accuracies, with SEN and SPE ranging in a recent study from 0.50-0.64 and 0.83-0.92, respectively. Project Goals and Broad Specific Aims: Validate a biomarker for LVO assessment which can be measured and displayed with a fully automated, non-invasive, transcranial Doppler (TCD) robotic system with performance at or exceeding 90% ROC–AUC (targeting SEN & SPE greater than 90%) to standard of care imaging. Complete a clinical study where Arm 1 demonstrates technical feasibility of the system in acute stroke settings and Arm 2 demonstrates safety, no detrimental change to standard of care, and collect robust data to submit to the FDA an IFU expansion to drive clinical care using our robotic system and the biomarker. The ultimate and future goal of this work is to use the automated device and validated VCI biomarker in a prehospital setting to show improved clinical outcomes after stroke onset due to improved prehospital triage. This work is critical to first validate the biomarker against gold standard CTA, which must be completed in a hospital, to ultimately be used in the pre-hospital setting. Longterm Objective: CTA will not be replaced in comprehensive stroke centers and we do not aim to use our technology to do this in comprehensive centers with CTA. Instead, our technology will be available in centers without CTA or MRA and ultimately in the prehospital environment. The goal of our company is to show that our lower cost, portable, non invasive technology can be used to measure a valid biomarker of large vessel occlusion that can be performed outside of a comprehensive stroke center. The first step is to validate the biomarker, in a center with CTA as a gold standard, which is the ultimate goal of this work. The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death. This work will validate a biomarker for large vessel occlusion (LVO) assessment which can be measured and displayed with a fully automated, non-invasive, transcranial Doppler (TCD) robotic system with performance at or exceeding 90% ROC–AUC (targeting SEN & SPE greater than 90%) to standard of care imaging. The ultimate goal of this work is to use the automated device and validated LVO biomarker in a prehospital setting to show improved clinical outcomes after stroke onset due to improved prehospital triage.",Prehospital Diagnostic Biomarker for Large Vessel Occlusion,9980675,U44NS109952,"['Acute', 'Ambulances', 'Angiography', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'operation', 'overtreatment', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'research clinical testing', 'robotic system', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety assessment', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'ultrasound blood flow measurement']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",U44,2020,699413,0.09074973245487786
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9988227,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,837117,0.07441957204224312
"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment.

"Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging Project Summary Every four minutes an American dies from stroke, equating to approximately 1 in every 19 US deaths annually. Strokes are classiﬁed as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes make up 87% of all strokes and are caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (or artery) resulting in a lack of blood to the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures releasing excess blood in or around the brain. Incorrect classiﬁcation can have dire consequences as treating a patient suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke (bleed) with anticoagulant drugs (used to dissolve blood clots for ischemic strokes) can prove fatal. Early action is of the utmost importance as each passing minute that brain cells lack the proper blood ﬂow additional cells die. Current classiﬁcation methods require tests performed at the hospital, e.g., CT or MRI scans of the patient's brain, leading to treatment delays. These delays are particularly lengthy for patients living in rural communities.  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that is inexpensive, has no ionizing radiation, and provides portable high-contrast images using harmless surface current and voltage measurements (e.g., on the head using a ﬂexible hat) to recover the internal point-wise electrical properties (e.g., inside the brain). EIT can recover conductivity, a measure of how easily current ﬂows through a material, as well as permittivity, a measure of the ability of a material to store a charge. A hemorrhagic stroke corresponds to an area of abnormally high conductivity due to the bleed, whereas an ischemic stroke presents as an area of lower conductivity than expected due cellular swelling from energy failure.  The proposed project addresses the important problem of early, fast, portable stroke classiﬁcation with EIT. A critical barrier for the use of EIT for stroke imaging has been the sensitivity of the image reconstruction algorithms to incorrect domain modeling and noise in the data. Due to these challenges, most research has focused on monitoring applications, not helpful for the classiﬁcation task. By contrast, the D-bar reconstruction method proposed here is the only proven noise and modeling error robust reconstruction method capable of recovering the true conductivity/permittivity using a low-pass ﬁltering in a nonlinear Fourier domain. D-bar methods have been successful in 2D but their development in 3D is stunted. This proposal focuses on the development of fast, robust D-bar based reconstruction methods for the 3D partial boundary problem, critical to working with stroke EIT data. Numerical algorithms will be developed for the full and partial boundary problems in 3D and validated on simulated and experimental data. A priori information, from anatomical atlases, will be embedded into the methods for increased resolution and stability. As the low-pass ﬁltering in D-bar methods leads to blurred reconstructions, post-processing through Convolutional Neural Networks will provide improved image quality. This work will be the ﬁrst to develop robust computational algorithms for 3D EIT data, opening the door for stroke imaging. Project Narrative Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), a portable imaging modality may provide early classiﬁcation of stroke type reducing treatment delays thus leading to improved patient outcomes. Existing image reconstruction algorithms for EIT are not robust to practical partial boundary data inherent to stroke imaging. Robust D-bar methods, aided with a priori information from anatomical atlases, will be developed in 3D to address the stroke classiﬁcation and monitoring tasks from practical EIT data.",Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging,9872170,R21EB028064,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'Ambulances', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Atlases', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrodes', 'Failure', 'Fourier Transform', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Rural Community', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer classification', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical methods', 'portability', 'reconstruction', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'tumor', 'voltage']",NIBIB,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,225182,0.1229557075453742
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs.

"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10104283,R01MH124752,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Imprisonment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Interruption', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prisons', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Security Measures', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States', 'Update', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prevention evaluation', 'prospective', 'study population', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide mortality', 'tool', 'years of life lost', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,769521,0.11204673336622616
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations. Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9882313,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,744627,0.123387787930884
"Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment Abstract The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a portable and affordable cranial x-ray-based Computed Tomography Perfusion (CT-P) device for expedited front-line evaluation and triage of ischemic cerebral stroke victims. CT-P is the gold standard modality for assessment and classifying stroke patients to determine the best candidates for revascularizing procedures; however, CT-P is generally unavailable early in the current acute care treatment model. Unlike existing conventional CT-P equipment which is generally large, expensive, and stationary, the proposed device would be compact, portable, and affordable to be deployed in nursing homes, urgent care centers, hospital ER triage areas, ICUs, and EMS response vehicles, yet also provide sufficient time and contrast resolution for reliable perfusion metrics. Rapidly acquired point-of-care CT and CT-P images showing blood flow, volume, and transit times will enable (1) early classification of hemorrhage or ischemic, and (2) assessment of the recoverable brain tissue volume. This will enable early screening evaluation for appropriate acute stroke patient prioritization and routing. In addition, it may also provide an economical and safe bedside means of assessing cranial perfusion for follow up care in the ICU, recovery room, or even eventually in a residential care setting. Xoran Technologies LLC specializes in point-of-care (POC) medical imaging and has successfully marketed over 750 POC imaging devices in the US. Project Narrative When an individual is suffering from acute stroke, time is of the essence; however, it is critically important to assess the type of stroke as well as the amount and location of potentially recoverable brain tissue to determine the appropriate routing and priority to achieve the best outcome for that individual. In this project a new compact and portable device is proposed that allows cranial perfusion studies to be performed earlier in the process than the current standard of care, potentially in a nursing home, urgent care center, or in an emergency vehicle such as an ambulance. Public health is affected both by the potential for improved outcomes for individuals, but also for systemwide cost savings and efficiency gains by not transporting patients who are not likely to benefit from a trip to a level one stroke treatment center.",Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment,10009036,R43NS117244,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'American Stroke Association', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equipment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health care facility', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nursing Homes', 'Ocular orbit', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery Room', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Teleradiology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vascularization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute care', 'acute stroke', 'arm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical center', 'commercial application', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'follow-up', 'functional independence', 'imager', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'phantom model', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'response', 'rural area', 'standard of care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke symptom', 'stroke therapy', 'stroke victims', 'treatment center', 'urgent care']",NINDS,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2020,249154,0.06392766380136738
"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt,9985179,R03MH118609,"['Arousal and Regulatory Systems', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention strategy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Societies', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive control', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'depressive symptoms', 'falls', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabotropic glutamate receptor 5', 'molecular imaging', 'mood regulation', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'radioligand', 'radiotracer', 'reducing suicide', 'relating to nervous system', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'targeted agent', 'translational impact', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,83750,0.11381913945365893
"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation.",DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY,10021035,U19NS115388,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Dementia', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical application', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive disability', 'cognitive load', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'disability', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'morphometry', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'non-demented', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'post stroke cognitive impairment', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'stroke event', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tau Proteins', 'vascular injury', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U19,2020,11092441,0.15115235775936214
