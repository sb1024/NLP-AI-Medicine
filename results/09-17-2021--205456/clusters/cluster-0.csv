"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9713512,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,647706,-0.02943423118416605
"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,-0.025044460561443403
"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9723527,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'environmental change', 'evidence base', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,326700,-0.0142954580840274
"Computational modeling of 60Hz STN DBS for gait disorder in Parkinson's disease Project Summary The therapeutic gain of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) has relied on high frequency stimulation (HFS) (e.g., 130-185Hz) to alleviate cardinal motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor, along with levodopa motor complications (e.g., motor fluctuations and dyskinesia). As the disease progresses, gait disorder, including freezing of gait, may emerge, increasing the risk of falls while limiting socialization and quality of life. Oftentimes, such symptoms are recalcitrant to dopaminergic medications and STN-DBS. Studies suggest that low frequency stimulation (60-80Hz) may improve gait in those with chronic DBS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 60Hz STN-DBS provides gait improvement within the first year of DBS implantation. However, there is limited data on the nature of this response, in terms of what aspects of gait respond and its relation to dopaminergic medications. In addition, based on preliminary results, it is possible to use machine-learning models to identify patients who may overall benefit from 60Hz STN-DBS based solely on preoperative assessments. However, the extent to which patients’ symptoms may improve under 60Hz STN-DBS needs to be further investigated. This project aims to (1) investigate the impact of 60Hz STN-DBS on gait kinematics using wearable sensors; and (2) develop machine learning models to predict response of STN-DBS patient symptomatology at both high frequency and 60Hz based on sensor profiles of PD motor symptoms at baseline. Parkinson’s patients with gait disorder who will either be undergoing STN-DBS implantation or already have chronic bilateral STN-DBS will be recruited. We will conduct the study in two phases: Phase I – obtain baseline kinematic profile for each subject in terms of tremor, bradykinesia, and gait using objective sensor measurements in the unmedicated and levodopa-ON states. We will specifically assess gait parameters within three domains: postural sway, gait speed and rhythm (cadence), and circumduction. Phase II – participants will be evaluated in two conditions: 1) OFF medication/ON stimulation; 2) ON medication/ON stimulation. Sensor-based gait analysis will be done in 60Hz and HFS modes for each DBS electrode contact pair in the different medication states. Following data collection, statistical analysis will be performed and machine learning models will be developed to accomplish aims (1) and (2). Accordingly, this study will help determine the aspects of gait influenced by 60Hz stimulation and how it is affected by levodopa, while potentially identifying certain 60Hz responsive PD phenotypic subtypes. It will also allow for instantaneous recommendations by artificial intelligence on which stimulation frequency is best suitable for a subject based on a priori sensor measurements of motor symptoms. The ranking provided can guide clinical evaluations and programming through a sensor guided paradigm.

"Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces Project Summary Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have the potential to transform communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease through personalized and real-time augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. Individuals with severe communication impairments who can no longer control their daily conversations or participate in previous life roles want AAC devices. And they want them to work – to be reliable, effective, and fast. ML and NLP are emerging as promising tools to bridge current technology and next generation devices for individuals with the most severe speech and physical impairments, like the RSVP Keyboard™, a brain-computer interface (BCI) being developed by the parent grant. BCI systems for communication are referred to as AAC-BCIs. NLP efforts to combine large public data sets with private data sets, such as personal email messages, promise to give individuals with communication impairments their own personalized language models, models that are sufficiently robust to get closer to real-time communication. The focus on getting AAC-BCIs to work with machine learning, however, has led to a critical oversight in the field: an inadequate understanding of why individuals want next-generation devices and what trade-offs they are willing to make for faster and more personalized communication. The turn to ML brings this oversight into sharp relief. Individuals should provide input about the data sets used to construct their personal language models, but this raises important ethical questions about what individuals value, how they understand their identity, and what trade-offs they are willing to make relative to their personalized communication data. The goal of this supplement is to fill this gap in understanding so that researchers can implement ML into next generation AAC-BCI systems in a way that is sensitive to the ethical concerns of future users. There are four components to this ethics supplement: (1) to design a toolbox of ethics vignettes tailored to ethical concerns raised by both BCI communication and ML; (2) to administer monthly vignette-based online ethics surveys to individuals with severe communication impairments due to motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS) (n=25) or movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease) (n=25); (3) to conduct semi-structured vignette-based interviews with individuals with pre- clinical or mild communication impairment due to motor neuron disease (n=10) or movement disorder (n=10). Components (2) and (3) will employ an iterative, parallel mixed-method approach. Trends in Likert-style online responses to ethics vignettes in the severe communication impairment cohort will be used to inform and modify the semi-structured interview prompts asked of the pre-clinical or mild impairment cohort. In parallel, themes emerging from direct content analysis of interviews will be used to refine online survey questions. Results of this iterative, mix-methods approach will be used (4) to outline a framework of core ethical domains and preliminary tools (vignettes and discussion prompts) that AAC-BCI researchers can use to assess ethical concerns while developing and iteratively refining communication technology for personalized language models. Project Narrative The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies. Bioethical issues about privacy, agency and identity must be included in technology development and implementation as the parent grant implements the translation of basic computer science and engineering into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.",Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces,9929337,R01DC009834,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'Award', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patient advocacy', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Voice', 'Work', 'advocacy organizations', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'communication device', 'computer science', 'design', 'expectation', 'informant', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'spelling', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,153834,-0.04944821716746668
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9688867,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,416786,-0.013080713620167635
"2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A 1.5-day symposium, StoneLab will be held December 6-7, 2019 at AUA Headquarters in Linthicum, Maryland, near BWI Airport. The novel StoneLab Symposium will be a meeting where kidney stone researchers can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, medical device design and development. We plan to encourage researchers to “think outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment. The target audience for this meeting includes: urologists, nephrologists, basic scientists, early-career investigators, residents, research fellows, and project management members of urology research teams in the area of nephrolithiasis and related technology development. It is essential that the urology community, and especially trainees, early-career physician- scientists, and researchers be provided with accessible opportunities to gain understanding of new knowledge and recent advances in not only their own fields, but in related fields that they may not otherwise be aware of, and leverage this for new research frameworks that can help improve the treatment of kidney stone disease. A critical aspect of the StoneLab Sympoisum is the delivery of talks from outside the normal realm of kidney stone research by leading basic scientists, followed by discussions led by kidney stone researchers and surgeons. The intent of these discussions is to spur the development of collaborations and the generation of new ideas and avenues for exploration. Another goal of the meeting is to help identify future funding needs and growth areas for kidney stone research. The R13 support requested in this application will encourage early investigators to participate in the workshop and stimulate their development as researchers and surgeon- scientists. This symposium will have a major impact by bringing together premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development, to explore solutions for the most pressing translational science issues facing kidney stone researchers today.

This meeting will explore solutions for the most pressing translational science issues facing kidney stone researchers today, research in interdisciplinary fields that might be leveraged for new research to improve treatment of kidney stone disease, and help identify future funding needs and growth areas for kidney stone research. A critical aspect of the StoneLab Sympoisum is the delivery of talks from outside the normal realm of kidney stone research by leading basic scientists, followed by discussions led by kidney stone researchers and surgeons with the intent to spur the development of collaborations and the generation of new ideas and avenues for exploration.",2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE,9914630,U13DK124023,"['American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Medical', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Methodology', 'Miniaturization', 'Nephrolithiasis', 'Nephrology', 'North America', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'career', 'career development', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'urologic']",NIDDK,AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION,U13,2019,10000,-0.019830538233461998
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,9699018,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,329650,-0.01962083188401027
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9765496,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,711064,-0.03655542503964615
"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) systemfor robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Our milestones for Phase I are as follows:  Milestone 1.1: Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptively Sparse Representation (EASRC) algorithm  successfully implemented and verified  Milestone 1.2: Implementation of Nessa adaptive learning algorithm and smartwatch interface  Milestone 1.3: User Needs and Design Inputs locked as a result of Focus Group testing  Milestone 1.4: Hold a pre-submission meeting with FDA for feedback on device classification and  planned product performance testing  Milestone 1.5: Hold a Scientific Steering Group (SSG) meeting  Milestone 1.6: Convene a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) and hold an initial meeting to review  clinical plans.  Milestone 1.7: Develop Clinical Study Protocol  Milestone 1.8: Register the study on www.clinicaltrials.gov. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) systemfor robust upper limb prosthesis control,9779227,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Calibration', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Freedom', 'Group Meetings', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Ownership', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'empowerment', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'myoelectric control', 'novel', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'prosthesis control', 'signal processing', 'smart watch']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2019,79250,0.015747049669185234
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9773039,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'assistive robot', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2019,329494,-0.01506529192757029

"CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare Project Summary/Abstract Family members with a relative with dementia often face complex, and stressful life situations that many other caregivers do not. Multiple factors make the adjustment to the caregiving role particularly hard, as the caregiver balances this role with other demands, including child rearing, careers, and relationships. For people with dementia, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and previously acquired knowledge are generally limited, making it difficult to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information. Tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently and an inability to remember events that occurred only a few days, hours, or even minutes previously makes day-to-day decision-making and navigating built environments difficult. The recall of routes and tasks may be unpredictable, therefore caregivers are often left with the constant and repetitive responsibility of prompting and cueing the care recipient, leading to additional stress in their caregiving role. This project aims to develop a low-cost wearable device to improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, and potentially create a new paradigm to provide assistance and care to individuals with dementia in a home environment. This innovative cognitive assistive technology, called CATcare, will be specifically designed to provide two-way assistance to the dementia caregiver and care recipient dyad living at home, enabling the individual with dementia more independence and situational awareness in the home setting, as well as improving his or her quality of life with less reliance on the caregiver. Caregivers, on the other hand, will be able to fully program, adjust, and customize the system for a given living environment according to the care recipient’s current habits, needs and conditions. This device can potentially prolong the period that the dementia patients stay at home and age in place, reducing the financial burden to both government and individuals as well as emotional and physical stress to caregivers. The proposed CATcare prototype not only encapsulates the newest hardware innovations (including smartglass and smartphone) but also advanced software solutions (including state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, computer vision techniques). In conclusion, this project will lead to the integration and development of an affordable, portable and versatile wearable intervention to address the long-standing and fast-growing challenges facing current and future dementia homecare. For individuals with dementia living at home, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently, leading to the responsibility of repetitive prompting and cueing by the caregiver. To improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, we propose to create an innovative wearable technology called CATcare which will be designed to provide navigational and cueing assistance to care recipients in the home environment. Our results will help provide a tool for two-way assistance by enabling caregivers to fully program, adjust and customize the system in order to support the individual with dementia with improved situational awareness and timely feedback in the home setting.",CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare,9656662,R15AG061833,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Route', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toothbrushing', 'United States', 'aging in place', 'built environment', 'care recipients', 'career', 'caregiving', 'cognitive change', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'grasp', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'model design', 'portability', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'smart home', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user centered design', 'way finding', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIA,OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY STILLWATER,R15,2019,437757,-0.025844590100219746
"Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Advances in health care have been dramatic since the beginning of the millennium. As a result, people are living longer with age-related diseases, and the number of older individuals unable to live independently is rising rapidly. Mobile computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor behavior and use the large amount of collected data to automate analysis of functional health in a person's everyday settings. This project focuses on evaluating the performance and commercial viability of technologies that will meet some of the needs that this coming age wave introduces by automating assessment of a person's functional performance. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health using behavior patterns as sensed by a smart watch. Achieving this objective will provide a foundation for the Phase II application goal of using multiple information sources to automatically-generate activity scores and functional health measures from sensor data. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach creates a profile of a person's routine behavior through automated real-time recognition of complex activities from mobile sensor data (Aim 1). We will evaluate the use of machine learning techniques to map behavior features onto cognitive and mobility health scores provided through app and in-person neuropsychological assessment (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate an interactive visual tool for displaying behavior patterns to provide individuals and their caregivers with insights on their routines and relationship with their health status (Aim 3). This work has important health care implications as functional impairment has been associated with negative outcomes including increased health care utilization, falls, and conversion to dementia. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, it is imperative to commercialize technologies that increase functional independence while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to evaluate the performance and commercial viability of an application that can predict an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health based on patterns that are sensed by a smart watch, and effectively and efficiently present this information to the caregiver. This work will lay the foundation for a commercial tool to analyze behavior routines and automate assessment of functional health.

"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9802783,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2019,488027,-0.026917963865264138
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,-0.05480579577749353
"Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome There is an essential gap in understanding the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior of adults with Down syndrome (DS): objective assessment of these behaviors with accelerometers has not been developed for this population. If this gap remains unfilled, it may impede efforts to objectively quantify the problem of inactivity in adults with DS and to develop effective interventions for improving physical activity and reducing health disparities in this population. Objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior for adults with DS will advance by considering their pathologically low aerobic fitness. It may also improve by applying to accelerometer output innovative machine-learning modes. The long-term goals of the present applicants are to understand the determinants of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS and develop effective interventions for improving their physical activity and health. The objective of this application, in pursuit of the long-term goals, is to calibrate accelerometer output for measuring physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with DS. The central hypothesis is that machine learning applied to accelerometer output will permit accurate prediction of physical activity type and intensity in adults with DS. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data and previous work that has successfully developed machine learning models for individuals without disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that accurate measurement of physical activity and sedentariness will lead to better monitoring of these behaviors in adults with DS and to more precise quantification of the effects of interventions for improving their health. Guided by the applicants’ preliminary data and previous work, and a critical review of the empirical knowledge-base, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) compare the relationship between accelerometer output and energy expenditure across various physical activities and sedentary behaviors between adults with and without DS; and (2) develop machine learning models from accelerometer output and evaluate their accuracy for predicting physical activity type and energy expenditure in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 1, output from hip- and wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers and energy expenditure expressed relative to aerobic fitness will be measured during physical activities and sedentary behaviors in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 2, machine learning models for predicting physical activity type and intensity will be developed in samples of adults with and without DS, and their prediction accuracy will be tested in two additional samples. The approach is innovative, because: (a) it will calibrate accelerometer output while accounting for aerobic fitness; (b) it will refine calibration by utilizing machine learning models. The proposed research is significant because it will allow researchers and public health agencies to more precisely monitor the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS. Such knowledge is critical for the development of interventions for improving physical activity, health, and quality of life in adults with DS. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing valid objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with Down syndrome is an essential step towards designing effective interventions for improving physical activity, fitness, health, and quality of life in these persons. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NICHD’s mission that pertains to ensuring the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.",Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome,9730779,R15HD098660,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Calibration', 'Data', 'Down Syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinesiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'graduate student', 'hands-on learning', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'national surveillance', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'therapy development', 'undergraduate student']",NICHD,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,423824,-0.05980325763846879
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices.

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",9976771,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,299863,-0.03703755166524944
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines.

"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"Technology-supported training and quality assurance for psychosocial interventions Millions of Americans receive psychosocial interventions such as psychotherapy each year for treatment of mental health, behavioral health, and addiction problems. Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services. In research settings, human-based behavioral coding methods are used, but these are time consuming, costly, and rarely used in real-world clinical settings.  Psychotherapy is a “talk based” treatment, and as such, the active ingredients and quality of the therapy are found in the spoken language and interaction of clinician and client. The current proposal will develop a software system (CORE-CBT) that will automatically generate a summary report of quality metrics for CBT, from an audio recording of a CBT session, using speech signal processing and machine learning. Importantly, the current work builds from previous, successful work in developing CORE-MI, an automated system for evaluating motivational interviewing for addiction. The existing CORE-MI tool and the expertise gained through its development will serve as the foundation for the current proposal.  Our technical team is complemented by clinical and implementation expertise via the partnership of the Beck Community Initiative (BCI) with Philadelphia’s DBHIDS. Since 2007, BCI has partnered in training staff at 60 programs in the DBHIDS network to deliver high-quality CBT, including objective quality ratings via the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). Through ongoing training efforts, the BCI has generated an archive of over 6,500 recorded CBT sessions, of which more than 2,300 have been CTRS-coded for quality. This session archive and ongoing real-world trainings in the DBHIDS network provide the perfect context to develop CORE-CBT, a tool that automates quality coding for CBT.  Aim 1: ​Extend and evaluate machine learning algorithms to automatically code CBT competence, using an archive of more than 2,000 CBT fidelity-coded sessions. ​Aim 2: ​Adapt and enhance front-end user interface and session reports with key stakeholders (frontline clinicians, supervisors, and clinic administrators), evaluating acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. ​Aim 3: ​Evaluate CORE-CBT technology during CBT training in 4 BCI partner clinics in the DBHIDS network, with approximately 48-64 frontline clinicians and 4,000 sessions, assessing both implementation outcomes (adoption, sustainment) and service outcomes (increased capacity, efficiency, and effectiveness of training). ​Aim 4:​ Evaluate the appropriateness of CORE-CBT and its metrics for quality assurance (clinics) and value-based reimbursement (payers), using an in-person participatory design workshop. An advisory board of behavioral health payers will provide feedback over the course of the study to maximize generalizability and future uptake in large healthcare systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers.

"BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II “Code blue” is the signal used in hospitals to call for an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following a cardiac or respiratory arrest. Reviewing the performance of the “code blue team” is a cornerstone for improving outcomes. The current standard of using handwritten records on a paper “code sheet” does not allow measurement of key quality indicators and is subject to human error. In the Phase I STTR project, we developed an electronic device for complete recording of code blue events, called BlueBox. The BlueBox is a small electronic recorder on an adhesive patch to be placed on the left chest next to the mid-sternum. The prototype we developed in Phase I was successfully tested on high fidelity mannequins and on pigs. In Phase II, our goal is to complete the product development and testing and prepare the BlueBox for regulatory clearance and market launch. To achieve this goal, we propose 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to complete the product development of the BlueBox device and the software user interface (UI) for the “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype we developed in Phase I into a product ready for commercialization through rigorous product development processes. We will develop a mobile app for iPads with a software UI for the “electronic code sheet.” Aim 2 is to conduct human factors and usability engineering (HF/UE) testing and prepare for regulatory submission. The alpha prototype will undergo HF/UE testing in the Simulation Center. We will establish and maintain quality management records and conduct a pilot production run of 200 units of BlueBox. Aim 3 is to validate the BlueBox system in a clinical study of code blues in the hospital. We will first conduct a pilot study of 5 code blue patients in the CCU and Cath Lab. Once the pilot study is successful, we plan to conduct a full clinical study of 100 patients recruited from the Harbor-UCLA ICU/CCU and emergency departments. The objectives of the clinical study are: 1) to establish equivalence of the electronic code sheet to the current standard of paper code sheet; 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electronic code sheet in identifying key CPR quality indicators. The criteria for successful development of the product will be that it passes all required regulatory testing and is validated in the clinical study for its equivalence and effectiveness in code blue recording. There will be two major milestones in this project: (1) finalizing product development with successful test production of 200 units; and (2) completing the clinical study and preparing for a 510(k) submission. Achieving the aims will result in a validated BlueBox system ready for submission to the FDA and commercialization. We intend to first introduce the BlueBox system to hospitals as a tool for staff training and quality improvement. We will continue the technology development with machine learning to provide instant feedback in the second generation BlueBox. Our ultimate goal is to minimize human error and improve patient outcomes through the BlueBox system's better documentation and continuous feedback mechanism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Debriefings and detailed reviews of the performance of the “code blue team” in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can improve quality of care and patient outcomes. In Phase I, we developed and successfully tested an electronic device, the BlueBox, for recording all CPR events and enabling full displays of code blue resuscitations in an “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype into a product ready for regulatory submission and commercialization in the proposed Phase II project.","BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II",9680137,R42GM113463,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adhesives', 'American Heart Association', 'Animals', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Code Blue', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Countershock', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Administrators', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Industrialization', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sternum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'commercialization', 'design', 'heart rhythm', 'human error', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile application', 'patient safety', 'product development', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"NEOVATIVE, INC.",R42,2019,723986,-0.005894491481101412
"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,-0.02262196927141533
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",9808966,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,294653,-0.025897003480790763
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,-0.017088271838589804
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9658873,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,317858,-0.009671616745010245
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,9818246,R01DK122473,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Elderly', 'Energy Intake', 'Feedback', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthy Eating', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastication', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'healthy weight', 'increased appetite', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'sucking', 'synergism', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'weight maintenance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2019,663683,-0.019585065647706786
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9755242,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'convolutional neural network', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,193160,-0.0023312230125281776
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,9813026,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Venous', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,531144,-0.025512822431932945
"Acquisition of a next-generation computing cluster We request funds to purchase our next-generation computing cluster to support computationally intensive NIH-funded research at Washington University in St. Louis. This system will become the foundation of the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) to support our active, diverse user community. It has been designed to meet our current and future computing needs. It adds additional capabilities to support emerging fields such as “Deep Learning”. The CHPC currently supports over 775 users from 300 different groups across 33 departments. 58 papers have cited the CHPC. The Center has a proven funding model and is economically sustainable. The Center has partnered with other University organizations to offer training workshops, not only on the use of the cluster, but also on introductory programming for users with no prior programming experience. If this proposal is funded, we will be able to continue to support this ever-growing diverse community of researchers. The proposed system would replace critical components including the management node, the login nodes, the storage, and upgrade the Infiniband networking. We would add substantial upgrades to our computing power with state-of-the-art processors, increased memory capacity for growing jobs, General Purpose Graphical Processing units (GPGPUs), and new capabilities for “Deep Learning”.

"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,-0.025160323508305875
"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",9847052,R44ES028656,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Disinfection', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'Wireless Technology', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'empowered', 'graphene', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead concentration', 'lead contamination', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'meetings', 'meter', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'operation', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water quality', 'well water']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2019,565059,-0.0030654486753291656
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance.

"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Burn injury', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic ulcer', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'S Phase', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Soft Tissue Disorder', 'Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Wound Healing', 'career', 'cost', 'experience', 'foot', 'healing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'point of care', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'speech recognition', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,-0.02915734710633924
"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Automation', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor V', 'Floor', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genotype', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heating', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperthermia', 'Institution', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Plant Resins', 'Prevention', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantum Dots', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Temperature Sense', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thermometry', 'Thermoreceptors', 'Thromboembolism', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'cell growth', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'gene function', 'graduate student', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'melting', 'new technology', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'success', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,-0.043224397014792124
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health.

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",9791705,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2019,1619137,-0.03419860540901227
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

"The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers Project Summary  One of the most glaring yet easily addressable gaps in our current scientific workflow and publication system is improving the way that methods are reported, in particular, the lack of key methodological details necessary for interpreting and reproducing a study. Most authors continue to cite the name of the reagent, like an antibody using the vendor, and the city where the vendor is located, but omit the catalog and lot number making antibodies very difficult to track down, thereby reducing reproducibility of the paper. The Resource Identification, RRID, Initiative has successfully implemented a solution to this lack of identification, by asking authors to include a persistent unique identifier (RRID) for each antibody along with a standard syntax that includes the lot information. This syntax is now required in about 100 journals and accepted in at least 400, was accepted into the EQUATOR network of standards and is under consideration by the JATS committee, the NISO standard for journal article metadata. For antibodies, RRIDs are assigned by the AntibodyRegistry.org, which accepts full catalogs from antibody companies and individual antibody records from authors, who are unable to locate the record for the antibody that they used in a study or one which they created in their lab. This process should be made as easy as possible for authors, and through text analysis we have devised a set of tools that should help authors create better records with less work.  The AntibodyRegistry.org was created as part of an academic project and it has successfully incorporated millions of antibody records, thousands of which have now been cited in scientific papers using the RRID syntax. The use of RRID is growing, and in order to support the longer term sustainability of the AntibodyRegistry.org, a core community authority for RRIDs, this resource needs to be enhanced to align with the available commercial and non-commercial funding sources. We propose the addition of features, valuable to antibody companies and journals, to improve market intelligence and reporting around antibodies. We also propose to auto-generate antibody entries for authors and curators when submitting/curating an antibody to decrease the time it takes to complete the task, thereby reducing the barrier to entry and cost. Project Narrative The AntibodyRegistry.org is a catalog of antibodies used in research and serves as the antibody identifier source for the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) initiative. The use of these identifiers improves rigor and transparency in compliance with both journal and NIH standards. As the RRID initiative grows, the AntibodyRegistry.org is becoming an increasingly well-used and valuable resource; requiring increased attention from curation staff. Improvements to the AntibodyRegistry.org are needed to increase commercial value and thereby its sustainability, decrease curation cost, and provide a higher level of service to the scientific community.",The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers,9680073,R41GM131551,"['Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Businesses', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Cities', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'information framework', 'journal article', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,"SCICRUNCH, INC.",R41,2019,149373,-0.027655437497473224
"Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a tool to help diagnose and monitor movement disorders. Due to increasing and aging world population, more people are living with these disorders. As there is already a shortage of neurologists, and more specifically, movement disorder specialists that have the training to adequately diagnose and manage these disorders, there is a large number of patients that are not receiving optimal treatment. We propose to use a smartphone-based platform to assess the severity of symptoms that are common across different movement disorders in order to achieve our long-term goal. To that end, the current study proposes to tackle 4 specific aims. The first aim will be to develop a mobile application to quantify common symptoms of movement disorders. We will develop a new mobile application that will enable the quantification of symptom severity; namely rest tremor, postural tremor, intention tremor, kinetic tremor, upper-limb coordination, bradykinesia, balance, gait, and cognitive impairments. The data collected from the smartphone-embedded sensors will be transmitted to a secure server where data can be visualized and analyzed. The second aim will be to collect data using the mobile application from healthy individuals as well as individuals with different movement disorders. We will collect data from 30 healthy controls, 30 individuals with Essential tremor (ET), 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), 30 individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), 30 individuals with primary focal dystonia (PFD) of the upper-limb, 30 individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, and 30 individuals with functional movement disorder (FMD). This dataset will enable us to develop algorithms (Aim 3) that will be used to assess symptom severity and differentiate the movement disorders according to the smartphone data. The third aim will be to develop algorithms to estimate symptom severity and distinguish the different movement disorders from one another. Using the data from the smartphone-embedded sensors, we will utilize machine learning approaches to estimate symptom severity (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, gait impairment, etc.). Then, based on the symptom severity estimation as well as from features extracted from the sensor data, we will classify the subjects in groups according to their clinical diagnosis. This will enable us to differentiate the selected movement disorders. Finally, the fourth aim will be to assess the usability of the smartphone platform for long-term monitoring of patients. Subjects of patients recruited for Aim 2 will be asked to use the smartphone application at home for 8 weeks in order to determine compliance with its use and its stability over time. This study will provide a novel tool to assess motor and non-motor symptoms that could be used in other areas of research. It will provide a large database of movement, cognitive, demographic, and medical history data of individuals with different movement disorders. Most importantly, it will help in the differentiation and monitoring of movement disorders to improve the clinical management of individuals with these disorders. The prevalence of movement disorders is on the rise due to the expanding and aging world population while there is a lack of trained specialists in, and especially outside, of developed urban centers to adequately diagnose and manage those individuals. We propose that the ubiquity of smartphones could be leveraged to help non- specialists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of movement disorders that often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as Essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary focal dystonia, spinocerebllar ataxia, and functional movement disorders. We will develop a smartphone application that will collect data during different tasks to help differentiate these disorders and monitor them over time.",Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders,9655625,R15NS109741,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Economics', 'Equilibrium', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Gait', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Dystonias', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Rest Tremor', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'equilibration disorder', 'functional disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NINDS,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R15,2019,399532,-0.021134152730367006

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,-0.017385499569388122
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9697702,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'convolutional neural network', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response', 'supervised learning']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2019,223354,-0.021489359722821597
"Phase II - HazPrep Worker Training - Community Risk Profile PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A worker's personal hazard profile (PHP) is a function of hazards present and his/her exposure level to those hazards. Workers with an elevated level of risk are those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working around - hazardous materials, waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response. inXsol’s Phase I feasibility study verified appeal and effectiveness of a new form of crowdsourced social learning platform. Our approach using cloud technology creates a dynamically growing library of incidents/scenarios, highly personalized (occupation/task/geo) risk profile and generates learning activities to train on risk awareness and mitigation techniques. The Phase II proposal includes implementation of an innovative use of big data algorithms for community profiles and fusion with PHP allowing for targeted and personalized training completing the HazPrep prototype developed and exercised by our beta test team in Phase I.

"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9852112,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,413898,-0.017442826209531498
"Expert Guiding Technology to Help Individuals with Developmental Challenges Build Life and Vocational Skills Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) remains the most effective and scientifically-validated approach to remediate the deficits due to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). There are serious challenges in delivering effective ABA: unavailability of effective treatment in many places; high instructor turnover; loss of program fidelity due to complexity and instructor variability; onerous data collection that directs attention away from the learner; and the time sink of creating required reports and charts that steals time away from instructional activities. A software platform named GAINS (Guidance, Assessment and Information System) is being developed that uniquely incorporates artificial intelligence to overcome problems in delivering ABA. GAINS is powered by expert guiding software that incorporates knowledge of ABA practice and curricula personalized for the individual with developmental challenges. Like Google Maps that guides you step-by-step and updates as you go along, GAINS guides instructors and caregivers and adapts to client responses on the fly. In this way, expert guiding technology reduces a priori training requirements in ABA while providing real- time apprenticeship coaching to overcome variability in instructor experience and improve program fidelity. Improved program fidelity promotes better learning outcomes of individuals with ASD and ID. The project will evaluate and iteratively innovate expert guiding technology to support the powerful, but difficult to implement, ABA technique of Task Analysis (TA). There are two overarching aims: 1) conduct scientifically-valid, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of expert guiding technology to support instructors to better help individuals with developmental challenges due to ASD and ID learn life and vocational skills and use the results in Phase I to develop larger, more comprehensive clinical trials to be conducted in Phase II; and 2) use clinical trials in Phase I and Phase II to more effectively identify and prioritize iterative innovations in expert guiding technology as part of successive Design Science Research Cycles. Single Case Research Designs (SCRD) will be used to evaluate expert guiding technology interventions to support Task Analysis. SCRDs are a viable alternative to large group studies such as randomized clinical trials. Single case studies involve repeated measures, and manipulation of an independent variable. SCRD studies allow for rigorous experimental evaluation of intervention effects and provide a strong basis for establishing causal inferences. Advances in design and analysis techniques for SCRD have made SCRD studies increasingly popular in educational and psychological research. Chimes Delaware will be the site for clinical trials. Chimes Delaware is one of the largest providers of community services for adults with intellectual, autism, and co-occurring disabilities. The project team has worked together for many years and is uniquely qualified. If successful, the increase of scientifically-validated technical capabilities of expert guiding technology will profoundly affect clinical practice. The clinical trials proposed in this project will provide new scientific knowledge on the efficacy of expert guiding technology to overcome problems in delivering quality ABA therapy. Iterative innovations of expert guiding technology will greatly increase the technical capabilities.

"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

This project aims to design, develop, and evaluate a data-science enabled personal health library called PhendoPHL to support the self-management needs of women living with endometriosis. Grounded in self-determination theory, and informed by user-centered design methods PhendoPHL will enable exploration of health patterns through interactive visualizations of integrated clinical and self-tracked data, identify temporal personalized patterns and comparison to population norms through novel data-science methods, and provide actionable visualizations of data for shared decision making during patient-provider encounters. PhendoPHL builds on our existing work in novel informatics methods for endometriosis, and the extensive experience of our research team in designing and evaluating novel informatics interventions. The proposed work also fills a research gap in personal health informatics: the development and validation of novel computational methods to identify personalized and population- based patterns in clinical and self-monitoring data; both types of data which are critical to successful self- management and challenging from a computational standpoint because they are temporal, heterogeneous, and sparse. Using a mixed-methods evaluation study (standardized surveys, logfile analysis, Critical Incident Technique interviews, focus groups), we will study PhendoPHL’s usability, assess the factors critical to user engagement and perceived impact on self-determination and shared decision making, and the generalizability to other reproductive chronic conditions in women’s health.

"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,9914633,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,297755,-0.03029700193612114
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9701262,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Uterus', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'multidimensional data', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2019,650539,-0.015295467674620042
"Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations Abstract The Simulation System for Emission Tomography (SimSET) is one of the foundational tools for emission tomography research, used by hundreds of researchers worldwide for both positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It has proven to be accurate and efficient for both PET and low energy SPECT studies; because SimSET uses a geometric model for its SPECT collimation, it is less accurate for high energy isotopes. This application proposes to address this with the use of angular response functions (ARFs), a technique that has proven to accurately model SPECT collimation and detection for high-energy isotopes more efficiently than full photon-tracking simulations. In addition, we propose a novel ARF-based importance sampling method that will speed these simulations by a factor of >50. The generation of ARF tables is another consideration: it is extremely compute intensive and has caused ARF to be used only when a large number of simulations are needed using the same isotope/collimator/detector combination. For this reason, we also propose application of importance sampling to speed the generation of ARF tables by a factor 5, and the creation of a library of angular response functions for popular isotope/collimator/detector combinations. The former will lessen the computational cost of generating the tables, the latter will, for many users/uses, eliminate the need to generate ARF tables at all. This will greatly expand the potential applications of ARF-based simulations. Our first aim is to accelerate SimSET SPECT simulations without sacrificing accuracy. This will be accomplished by synergistically utilizing two tools: variance reduction and angular response function (ARF) tables. Variance reduction includes importance sampling and forced detection. We hypothesis that these techniques combined with information from our angular response function tables will improve SimSET simulation efficiency by >50 times of SPECT simulations of specific radioisotopes (e.g., I-123, Y-90, etc.). Our second aim is to accelerate ARF table generation. This will be accomplished by using importance sampling methods in the generation of ARFs. We further propose to use an adaptive stratification scheme that will simulate photons for a given table position only as long as required to determine its value to a user-specified precision. Our third aim is to create a library of pre-calculated ARF tables for popular vendor isotope/collimator/detector configurations. These ARF tables will then be made publically available for download through the SimSET website. With a registered user base of >500, we believe that these enhancements to SimSET will have far reaching impact on research projects throughout the world. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop methods to speed up the SimSET Monte Carlo-based simulation software for single photon computed tomography (SPECT) imaging systems by greater than 50-fold. This type of speed up with enable new research that was previously impractical due to the computation time required for simulation. In addition, all software tools and tables developed within this project will be made available via a web-based host.",Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations,9751297,R03EB026800,"['90Y', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Collimator', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Industrialization', 'Institution', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Photons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radioisotopes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vendor', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cost', 'detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'response', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'synergism', 'thallium-doped sodium iodide', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R03,2019,77750,-0.014902005981746085
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9671858,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2019,613264,-0.004389109450115716
"Enabling of a Wireless and Remotely Monitored Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Internet of Medical Things for Parkinson's Disease Patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a Bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system with remote patient monitoring. DBS has become an established neurosurgical procedure with over 160,000 patients treated worldwide. DBS has been shown to improve Parkinson's disease (PD) patient quality of life, increase long term tremor control, reduce dyskinesia, and reduce hyperdopaminergic behavioral symptoms. Some of the most common complications associated with this procedure are injury caused by wire/lead tunneling, erosions or infections of the tunneled wires, lead failure/migration, and tethering of extension cables. None of the current solutions are leadless and allow for remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices in the body. Bionet Sonar's software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than RF waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) Reprogrammable wireless stimulation leads; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent DBS device that can be monitored by clinicians and provide feedback control to optimize therapy using remote continuous real-time data will lead to improved PD treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled deep brain stimulation, recharging and remote monitoring components using ultrasonic waves at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo, data and energy transmission for the systems during controlled stimulation of the brain. In vivo experiments in minipig models (n=3) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes using closed loop control based on real time electrical sensing. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet Sonar Inc. and the University of Louisville. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet Sonar system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored deep brain stimulation system will be developed using new core technology for the Internet of Medical Things. Ultrasonic wideband technology will be used to enable wireless communication and recharging of the different implantable elements, allowing for miniaturization and energy efficiency. This technology will not only improve the outcomes and healthcare economics of the Parkinson's disease patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Enabling of a Wireless and Remotely Monitored Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Internet of Medical Things for Parkinson's Disease Patients,9908204,R43NS115226,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bilateral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Drops', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Essential Tremor', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intrabody', 'Lead', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manic', 'Medical', 'Miniature Swine', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stomach', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'migration', 'monitoring device', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'preclinical efficacy', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'safety testing', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NINDS,BIONET SONAR,R43,2019,328562,-0.009007883296354314
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9732337,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318886,-0.013075832622588929
"Stasys Medical: A Rapid, Microfluidic Blood Test Sensitive to Platelet Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. While monitoring platelet therapy is of increasing importance for the identification of hypo- or hyper-responsive patients, there is not a clear picture of the medical value of tailored antiplatelet therapy using currently available platelet function tests. Currently, US FDA cleared assays of platelet function designed to be near the patient measure platelet adhesion and aggregation. Stasys Medical is developing a system based on patented platelet contraction sensors to assay platelet contraction force as a biomarker for platelet dysfunction. In the current project, the Company will build on preliminary data to demonstrate that the force biomarker is sensitive to platelet inhibition via multiple pathways. Specifically, aims are designed to 1) correlate the platelet contractile force measurements to inhibition of platelet activation and adhesion pathways, and 2) benchmark the force assay to standard platelet function tests. The go/no-go criteria for moving to Phase II is demonstration that platelet force is sensitive to specific inhibitors and that the assay can identify platelet dysfunction currently missed by existing standard platelet function assays. In the Phase II project we will leverage data generated in the current project to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify antiplatelet medications. Clinically, this will be a valuable tool to identify medication non-responders. Taken together, the project will be used to support the Company’s 510(k) submission to FDA with claims directed at evaluating platelet function to assess clinical conditions, such as bleeding risk, associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs, and during and following cardiovascular surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. In the Phase I project, Stasys Medical will build on preliminary data to show that the platelet contraction force biomarker reflects platelet function as proof-of-concept that the force assay can identify platelet dysfunction missed by existing assays.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9750520,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2019,507856,-0.011890906613444618
"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9791152,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,546052,-0.03393754261239094
"Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery. These are high priority objectives of the partner institutions in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia and align with the objective of CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria of the Center for Global Health to refine malaria interventions and develop new tools to stay ahead of the curve and ensure its global investments continue to be successful.",Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,9787224,U01GH001646,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2019,100000,-0.018052595920824095

"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9762992,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'E-learning', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2019,30689,-0.011302466899958202
"Augmented Reality Platform for Feedback and Assessment in STEM elementary education ABSTRACT This SBIR Phase I project will build evidence-based content, challenges and assessments that promote: simulation-based learning; troubleshooting and critical-thinking; and diversity and inclusion in STEM learning. The approach will be transferable by design to teaching and measuring learner performance across scientific disciplines. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is already transforming science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future. These technologies have promise in delivering simulation environments capable of nurturing deep learning and higher-level thinking in K-12 students through practical experience, hand-on exercises and real-life applications, such as troubleshooting. Digital AR and VR educational content is beginning to address and develop these skills, but a platform has yet to be developed to effectively enable broad adoption in elementary settings. Cost efficient methods to provide formative feedback and gather summative evaluations for Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is also an unmet need. The successful completion of the proposed project will provide an evidence-centered content delivery and assessment framework as well as tool for addressing NGSS performance expectations that is transferable across topic areas and readily scalable for large-scale national implementation. The content will intentionally incorporate aspects of context and diversity of characters to ensure inclusion of groups that are historically underrepresented – specifically females and ethnic minorities. NARRATIVE Success in the workforce of the future will require the high-level thinking skills that the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is transforming science and engineering education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future, through practical simulation-based experiences, but these lack the capability for performance assessment crucial to teachers and decision makers.

"Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Supplement Application PROGRAM SUMMARY The current Supplement application is developed under an NIH ICEMR award entitled “Environmental Modifications in Sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria” (U19 AI129326). The overarching objective of this Supplement application is to facilitate malaria control and elimination efforts in Kenya and Ethiopia, the two study countries of our ICEMR, by obtaining entomological and socio-behavioral data needed for introducing new vector control tools and by identifying optimal combinations of vector interventions to achieve the maximum impact in reducing malaria burden. The Supplement application has three projects, each with multiple specific objectives. Project 1 will evaluate the impact of spatial repellents on pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors in MalariaSpheres, a contained semi-natural Anopheles ecosystem for studying mosquito behaviors in Kenya and Ethiopia. Project 2 will examine the social behavioral aspect of malaria vector control, especially the gaps between knowledge and mosquito control practice in the community and the underlying mechanisms for such gaps. Project 3 aims to develop an optimal malaria intervention strategy adaptive to local malaria risk, changing vector ecology, and supply chains, using a cluster randomized sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design. The research proposed in the Supplement application leverages the baseline data, infrastructure, and capacity established by the parent ICEMR and extends it to malaria control goal by generating data critically needed for future field trials of new mosquito control products, identifying new approaches to improve community engagement, and developing new strategies to improve the effectiveness of malaria vector control programs. As insecticide resistance is widespread in Africa and the effectiveness of the current first-line malaria vector control tools need to be improved, knowledge gained from this Supplement application will be valuable to malaria control, not only for the two countries studied under this ICEMR but also for other regions in Africa and potentially elsewhere. Project Narrative This Supplement application will determine the impact of new mosquito repellents on insecticide resistant malaria vectors, bridge the gap between community knowledge on malaria and actual practice in the field, and develop new vector control strategies to maximize the cost-effectiveness on malaria incidence reduction. The knowledge and results from this project will greatly facilitate the malaria control and elimination efforts in Kenya and Ethiopia.","Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria",9706616,U19AI129326,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Agriculture', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Controlled Environment', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Entomology', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethiopia', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Humoral Immunities', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Irrigation', 'Kenya', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mosquito Control', 'Parasites', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Perception', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Predisposition', 'Primaquine', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resource Development', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Behavior', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Water', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'effective intervention', 'environmental change', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'human migration', 'improved', 'knowledge of results', 'malaria transmission', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'randomized trial', 'social', 'social media', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U19,2019,722400,-0.007992990620892877
"Personalized Digital Behavior Change Interventions to Promote Oral Health Although preventable, dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States and exacts a substantial personal and societal toll. It is closely linked to low oral health literacy and poor oral hygiene behaviors (OHBs). Using the high prevalence and burden of dental disease as a proxy, there is a large gap between knowledge about quality oral hygiene routines and what is practiced by individuals. The causes are many but ultimately distill down to a systemic failure to communicate oral hygiene instructions (OHIs) effectively or to engage and motivate patients in their own oral self-care.  To address the know-do gap, we begin by distilling desired brushing behaviors into a simple 2x2x4 OHI (brushing 2 times a day, for 2 minutes each time, all 4 dental quadrants). We will leverage tracking capabilities of our innovative eBrush platform to remotely monitor tooth-brushing activities in home settings. Using the 2x2x4 OHI and eBrush as foundational elements, we will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of personalized Digital Oral Health Interventions (DOHI) for promoting ideal OHBs in at-risk individuals. In the UG3 phase, we will build out the technologic infrastructure for collecting brushing data and delivering the DOHI. Then, we will engage target end-users in the co-design of an app for oral self-care and establish the usability and feasibility of the system. In the UH3 phase, we will build and validate computational models to infer the quality of OHBs from brushing data and personalize the DOHI. Using a cohort of 130, we will conduct a 10-week Micro-Randomized Trial to optimize the adaptive tailoring of engagement strategies. Finally, we will evaluate effectiveness of the computationally-driven, adaptive DOHI in promoting sustained engagement in the 2x2x4 OHB. We hypothesize that a dynamic and personalized DOHI will be more effective than traditional, static, clinician-delivered OHI in improving oral health and adherence to 2x2x4 OHBs. We will test our hypothesis through a 6-month, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Eligible adults from safety-net dental clinics will be equipped with an electronic toothbrush and the smartphone app for tracking brushing data. After a run-in period (4 weeks) to ensure technical proficiency and establish baseline OHBs, 260 at-risk subjects will receive a clinician-delivered 2x2x4 OHI and randomized to either: (a) an intervention arm where subjects receive ongoing, personalized DOHIs at opportune times; or (b) a control arm where subjects lack such feedback. Subjects will be followed for 20 weeks. Trained dental examiners will conduct assessments at each visit (baseline, randomization and after 20 weeks). Primary outcomes are changes in dental health from baseline (Modified Gingival Index and Plaque Index). Secondary outcome is the quality of adherence to the 2x2x4 OHI. We will explore subject-level features that predict the magnitude of response to the DOHI. Our team science approach presents a potentially paradigm shifting opportunity to leverage the growing ubiquity and reach of digital technologies to activate, educate, and engage patients in optimal oral health self-care in ways and at a scale previously unimaginable. 3c. Project Narrative Dental disease is caused primarily by poor oral hygiene behaviors. Our research will contribute to the development of technology-assisted behavioral interventions that use electronic toothbrushes and mobile phone apps to provide individuals with personalized feedback on their brushing behaviors and eventually, improve oral health and decrease dental disease.",Personalized Digital Behavior Change Interventions to Promote Oral Health,9741950,UG3DE028723,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioethics', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Clinics', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental caries', 'Dentistry', 'Dentists', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Gingival Indexes', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procter Gamble', 'Proxy', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Self Care', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Tooth Diseases', 'Toothbrushing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adaptive intervention', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'blind', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'handheld mobile device', 'health literacy', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'personalized predictions', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'technology development', 'treatment arm', 'usability']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,UG3,2019,100000,-0.01535650320320073
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9702069,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,167319,-0.029930732284324
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9780348,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2019,41136,-0.0022076856404553598
"VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. A healthy dietary pattern is paramount in disease risk reduction. Since 2010, the dietary pattern approach has been recommended to examine the relation of the totality of diet and health outcomes by U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees; meanwhile longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. Yet, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing longitudinal diet-quality variations and even rudimentary for validating diet- quality patterns that describe these dynamic variations, therefore, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health/disease relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field. We propose to develop an innovative statistical learning tool for diet-quality trajectory pattern-recognition based on rich and highly-comparable longitudinal dietary datasets from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OS) pertaining to a variety of individuals, race/ethnicities, and geographical locations, and spanning up to 30 years, collected across 4 NIH- funded RCTs in Massachusetts, and 2 large-scale multi-site national RCT and OS studies as well as simulated dietary data based on these trials. Our project builds on PI Fang’s NIH-funded behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition tool (Multiple-Imputation based Fuzzy Clustering, MIFuzzy) which processes longitudinal trial data with missing and zero-inflated values, and identifies latent trajectory patterns that characterize patients’ complex engagement and cognitive response variations during multi-component RCTs and better explains the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This project will enhance and expand MIFuzzy to a Visual- Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition tool (VIP), adapted to diet-quality trajectory pattern analyses and chronic disease risk assessment. Our goal is to provide a new multi-view of diet-quality trajectory patterns and associated outcomes from longitudinal studies. Based upon high-quality and comparable RCT and OS longitudinal dietary data from NIDDK-, NHLBI-, and NIMH-funded studies, this VIP project will help grow more valid evidence for developing dietary guidelines and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of patient/individual types, potentially enabling better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Developing this evidence-based VIP tool will also contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern- recognition methods, help scientific communities and the lay public compare with local and national diet-quality guidelines, and assess dietary health risks. In the long run, this VIP project will contribute to creating a data management platform that support near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Evaluating diet quality and encouraging healthful dietary change is paramount for preventing, or managing, many chronic conditions and diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our innovative Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern-recognition (VIP) method will identify clusters of distinct diet-quality patterns in multiple longitudinal dietary datasets from local and national NIH-funded randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This work will help formulate stronger evidence for national dietary guidelines, deepen our understanding of diet quality trajectory patterns, and elucidate relationships between these patterns and chronic diseases for a range of patient/individual types; it can potentially enable personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Open-access dissemination of our diet quality pattern recognition tool will contribute to the infrastructure of dietary-intervention studies, advance pattern recognition methodology, and help the scientific community and the public to compare individual dietary behaviors with local and national diet-quality patterns and associated health risks.",VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials,9907572,R56DK114514,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Reduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'good diet', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R56,2019,452178,-0.024149123708618016
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion.

"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will take existing research software and significantly enhance it so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",9882671,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,399297,-0.02122865549216276
"Adaptive & Individualized AAC The heterogeneity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions such as manual signs, gestures or dexterous interaction with a touchscreen for communication. While efforts to develop alternative access methods through eye or head tracking have provided some communication advancements for these individuals, all current technologies suffer from the same fundamental limitation: existing AAC devices require patients to conform to generic communication access methods and interfaces rather than the device conforming to the user. Consequently, AAC users are forced to settle for interventions that require excessive training and cognitive workload only to deliver extremely slow information transfer rates (ITRs) and recurrent communication errors that ultimately deprive them of the fundamental human right of communication. To meet this health need, we propose the first smart-AAC system designed using individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. Preliminary research by our team of speech researchers at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital (Communication Center Lab) and Boston University (STEPP Lab), utilizing wearable sensors developed by our group (Altec, Inc) have already demonstrated that metrics based on surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer measures of muscle activity and movement for head-mediated control can be combined with optimizable AAC interfaces to improve ITRs when compared with traditional unoptimized AAC devices. Leveraging this pilot work, our team is now proposing a Phase I project to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that a single sEMG/IMU hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in ITR and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is optimized through machine learning algorithms. The prototype system will be tested and compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface in subjects with SPI at a collaborative clinical site. Assistance by our speech and expert-AAC collaborators will ensure that all phases of technology development are patient-centric and usable in the context of clinical care. In Phase II we will build upon this proof-of-concept to design a smart-AAC system with automated optimization software that achieves dynamic learning which adapts to intra-individual changes in function through disease progression or training as well as inter-individual differences in motor impairments for a diverse set of users with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, ALS, and other SPIs. The innovation is the first and only AAC technology that combines advancements in wearable-sensor access with interfaces that are autonomously optimized to the user, thereby reducing the resources and training needed to achieve effective person-centric communication in SPI, through improved HMI performance and reduced workload. This project addresses the fundamental mission of NIDCD (National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders) to provide a direct means of assisting communication for people with severe physical impairments caused by stroke, high level spinal cord injury, neural degeneration, or neuromuscular disease. Leveraging wearable access technology (which has barely been explored for AAC users), we will develop a first-of-its-kind adaptive tablet interface tailored to individual users through advanced movement classification algorithms. Through these efforts, we aim to provide an improved Human Machine Interface (HMI) that is able to accommodate varying degrees of inter- and intra-subject residual motor function and context dependent impairments to provide individuals with SPI the opportunity for improved societal integration and quality of life.",Adaptive & Individualized AAC,9907832,R43DC018437,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'American', 'Boston', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fatigue', 'Forehead', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human Rights', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'communication device', 'deafness', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering', 'rehabilitation science', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'signal processing', 'technology development', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2019,224701,-0.03914728560103005
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes. n/a",Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry,9903672,R01GM135927,"['Accelerometer', 'Activity Cycles', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Big Data', 'Body Temperature', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Dust', 'Encapsulated', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'circadian', 'design', 'diaries', 'health related quality of life', 'heart rate monitor', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'metastatic colorectal', 'multimodality', 'personalized intervention', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,316425,-0.021991817952638496
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032) Project Summary/Abstract Technology has the potential to accelerate clinical research and reduce the burden of participation in rare diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an x-linked genetic disorder that results in progressive muscle weakness with loss of ambulation by 10-12 years of age, progression of arm weakness resulting in difficulty with self-feeding and other self-care activities in adolescence, and death resulting from cardiopulmonary insufficiency by age 30 years. Studies in rare diseases are inherently difficult due to a small recruitment pool and a limited number of sites that possess the experience and resources to participate as a study site. An outcome measure that quantifies change in both ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with minimal evaluator training could enable more efficient data collection in multi-site clinical trials. Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), has the potential to meet this need. ACTIVE is a 65-second game utilizing a skeletal-tracking algorithm to quantify workspace volume (WSV) elicited through maximal arm reaching overhead, side-to-side, and forward while also encouraging trunk lean in each direction. Our studies have shown that ACTIVE is valid and reliable in quantifying WSV in persons with DMD across the span of age and abilities. However, to increase access and portability of a tool for use across trial sites, it is critical that tool has sound scientific and technological construction. ACTIVE WSV was originally built upon the Microsoft Kinect and Kinect One for Xbox platforms. The skeletal tracking algorithm developed by Microsoft vastly exceeds all other programs as it had the full backing of the Microsoft machine. Unfortunately, the Kinect, in its additional sense, has been abandoned for more current artificial intelligence applications. The Microsoft Kinect Azure will soon be released with higher resolution and programming capabilities. Our full DDT submission has been delayed as each new camera release has required reprogramming of our software to ensure valid and reliable results. Our team has recently expanded to include software development partners, The Plan Works (thePlan), who have the technological expertise to alter our current codebase to ensure transfer of ACTIVE across camera sensor platforms is more efficient and reliable as we expect ongoing technological advances to provide opportunities for continued advances. To this end, our current application seeks support to verify the technology of the ACTIVE WSV system to 1) confirm the use of unique code that can be ported across platforms over time and 2) improving the ease of use and limit training needed at a growing number of inexperienced centers. Project Narrative Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), is a 65-second outcome assessment that quantifies a person’s workspace volume and has the potential to expand the enrollment pool by measuring both ambulant and non-ambulant subjects. While the scientific construction of the tool is sound, ongoing technological advances and changes have made it challenging to port our software across camera platforms. Our proposal seeks funding to support final software updates to ensure changes in technology components (i.e. camera sensor systems) or coding instability will not interfere with clinical trial data collection and allow us to complete our final submission package.",ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032),9989528,U01FD006883,[' '],FDA,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,U01,2019,215170,0.0011087492639646904
"Improving the Pelvic Health of Women and Girls Through the Use of a Digital Coaching Platform ABSTRACT More than 50 million women suffer from pelvic health disorders (PHDs) in the United States, a number that is projected to nearly double by 2050. These conditions cost the healthcare system billions annually and negatively affect educational and employment opportunities, quality of life, and fertility of patients. While studies suggest that PHDs can be managed and improved with education, practitioners are often confronted with patients who delay seeking treatment until their symptoms and conditions are advanced. Below Your Belt (BYB) is developing a platform that disrupts the costly, painful, and stigmatizing cycle of poor pelvic health in the U.S. The platform is a mobile, web based, a consumer-facing chatbot, with a working name of CeCe, that delivers pelvic health information in a familiar, accessible manner. CeCe will engage Mom with interactive and medically accurate content, positioning her to become the central source of information for her family and her social network. BYB has developed and tested a functional prototype of CeCe, which is based on feedback received from hundreds of women surveyed. In Phase I, BYB, together with Northwestern University and a highly qualified team of consultants will optimize CeCe and test the feasibility and acceptability of a chatbot to deliver pelvic health information. In Aim 1, The current prototype will be examined and enhanced to a web-based platform. Simultaneously, verified conversational and educational material will be added to the existing content to make it more robust. Then, a round of usability testing will be conducted. Updates to content and functionality will be completed based on initial usability results, and if any issues are uncovered, they will be addressed before the start of Aim 2. In Aim 2, Northwestern University will conduct a larger usability and knowledge-gained study with 36 women (recruitment target of 30% low income women). Questionnaires will be used to ascertain whether participants had measurable increase in knowledge after completing the two-week interaction with CeCe and to assess ease of use/acceptance. Exit interviews will be conducted to gain qualitative data around ease of use, interest in CeCe, content preferences, perceptions of achievement in relation to increased awareness of pelvic health and confidence or comfort sharing pelvic health information. At the conclusion of Phase I, BYB will have successfully demonstrated that CeCe’s final prototype is an acceptable and feasible model for increasing pelvic health knowledge. In addition, BYB will have a complete assessment of CeCe’s acceptability and insight into participants’ 14-day experience with the chatbot, and an understanding of whether a mom might feel confident or comfortable sharing any information she has learned. NARRATIVE Over 50 million women suffer from pelvic health disorders in the U.S. (projected to nearly double by 2050), which negatively affects their physical, emotional and intimate well-being and costs the healthcare system billions annually.

"2020 Nanoscale Science and Engineering for Agriculture and Food Systems Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary The objectives of this GRC are: 1) To bring together experts and stakeholders to discuss nanotechnology advances, directions, and needs in food and agriculture; 2) To identify cutting-edge research and emerging opportunities to address global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, food safety, and agricultural productivity. A major goal of this GRC is to promote exceptional early career and female investigators, as well as those of traditionally underrepresented populations, to ensure the continued growth in diversity of scholars in our vibrant community. A diverse range of invited speakers and discussion leaders will present a comprehensive vision of critical and emerging nanotechnology research advances across the field of agricultural science. The program illustrates a targeted excellent diversity of leadership (6), speakers (23), and discussion leaders (11) across the spectrum of: i) gender diversity (19 females, 21 males); ii) USA (24) /International participation (16), representing Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan; and iii) industry and government (3), which includes the FDA, FAO, a founder of a blockchain startup company, and senior research scientist at a non-governmental organization. The following topics will be included in the program: Food and nutrition, bioinspired and targeted technologies, sensing and tracking, microbiomes, food contact materials and human health and disease. Discussions on the safe deployment of nanotechnology in these areas, public perception and policy, and influence on industry and entrepreneurship are integral to this GRC. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. The significant contributions of this diverse population will provide the strong intellectual infrastructure required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications in food and agriculture in direct support of the FDA CFSAN goal of ensuring the safety, security, sanitation, and proper labeling of the U.S. food supply. Project Narrative Nanomaterials and nanotechnology are rapidly entering almost every industry around the world. The co-chairs of this GRC envision that the convergence between nanotechnology, biotechnology and information science within plant science, animal science, crop and food science/technology and environmental science will lead to revolutionary advances in improving public health. The successful achievement of this lofty vision requires the profound intellectual commitment of scientists and engineers in a highly integrated engagement across numerous disciplines. Some success examples with a focus on nanotechnology in food include: nano- biosensors for identification of pathogens, toxins and bacteria in foods; identification systems for tracking animal and plant materials from origination to consumption; development of nanotechnology-based foods with lower calories and with less fat, salt and sugar, while retaining flavor and texture; integrated systems for sensing, monitoring and active response intervention for plant and animal production; “smart field systems” to detect, locate, report and direct application of water; precision and controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides; development of plants that exhibit drought resistance and tolerance to salt and excess moisture; and nanoscale films for food packaging and contact materials that extend shelf life, retain quality, and reduce cooling requirements. Overall, nanoscale science and engineering has an important role in creating a safer and more productive agriculture and food system. Commercial advances and technological impacts have been limited somewhat due to the relative “newness” of nanotechnology in agriculture and food systems. Given that research at the nanoscale in agriculture and food systems is only into its second decade, safety of nano-enabled applications in agriculture are still up for debate. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. In the spirit of the GRC mission, the 2020 Nano Ag & Food GRC and GRS will again bring together a diverse array of scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs, and graduate students from academia, as well as scientists and engineers from business, government, and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs); with an emphasis to attract researchers from around the world to engage in open scientific exchange.

"Environmental Imaging and Control for Exoskeletons to Improve Safety and Mobility Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system to improve the mobility and control of exoskeletons. Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and the number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year. While wheelchairs provide freedom, allowing users to be independent as well as reducing dependence upon others, wheelchair use is not physically or emotionally equivalent to walking and is often thought to limit community participation and thus exacerbate social isolation. Robotic exoskeletons/bionic suits have the potential to enable these individuals to stand up and walk, thus providing a way to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society. Our proposal seeks to address one of the hurdles limiting the widespread adoption of exoskeletons in the home and community—the inability of the user to dynamically control gait parameters. This concept has the potential to significantly change the way exoskeletons work and facilitate their adoption into the market. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the proposed solution will provide users a practical way to adjust their suit’s gait to precisely achieve their navigational goals. Specific Aims: Phase I: 1) Build a prototype and Perform Preliminary Laboratory Testing; 2) Develop and Benchmark Algorithms; and 3) Perform Pilot Human Study of Prototype with Exoskeleton Subjects. Phase II: 1) Develop Customized, Production-Ready Hardware and Firmware 2) Integrate with Exoskeleton Control System; and 3) Perform an evaluation of the system through human study testing.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,-0.04216630430511692
"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings.

"Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration There is an enormous deficit in students’ understanding of fractions in the United States. Fifth grade fraction knowledge predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Therefore, addressing this deficit is a particularly important area for early intervention. With this Fast-Track grant, Deep Fractions Learning , we propose to transform the way in which students learn core math curriculum so that materials are more interactive and engaging, promote deeper learning of content, and are aligned with the Common Core. More specifically, we will develop and evaluate a digital curriculum for grades 3-5 covering the fractions domain that combines games, collaboration, and an inquiry approach. We propose to develop an innovative technology infrastructure that will integrate Teachley learning games, Success for All’s (SFA) cooperative learning framework, and rigorous lesson content. We will integrate research into the design process and work with Johns Hopkins University to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Outcomes. The intervention will encourage four direct outcomes for students, namely improved: 1) conceptual understanding of fractions, 2) procedural fluency with fractions operations, 3) mathematical justification, and 4) motivation. First, the curriculum will build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, providing strong visual models within engaging games that motivate students to practice. The collaborative learning model and inquiry approach will improve students’ mathematical justification. Finally, we encourage these outcomes within a motivational support structure designed to foster engagement and self-efficacy. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in the area of fractions during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since each additional math class students complete in high school more than doubles the odds of college completion (Adelman, 2006), the intervention has the potential to make a real difference in whether students achieve sustainable careers versus being stuck in low-wage jobs. Fractions knowledge in the fifth grade strongly predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Intervention in this essential content area will improve students’ math ability in the short and long term, which in turn will lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as greater high school graduation rates and college attendance.","Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration",9789518,R44GM130162,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Common Core', 'Control Groups', 'Demographic Factors', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graduation Rates', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Mathematics Curriculum', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'boys', 'career', 'college', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'girls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mathematical ability', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reading ability', 'success', 'teacher', 'third grade', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,463456,-0.005528137993981445
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9838988,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2019,1705298,-0.02569291431834261
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10012469,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2019,1908341,-0.048404643763481824
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9778054,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,779815,-0.027905331059844822
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,-0.02818687625515557
"Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication Project Summary Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for people with severe speech and motor impairments (SSMI) rely on residual motor function, inherently limiting communication throughput. Commercially available AAC solutions require daily caregiver setup, need frequent recalibration often from a technically savvy caregiver, are often unable to be used in dark lighting conditions, and can encumber or fatigue important remaining physical abilities. Furthermore, for people with progressive motor dysfunction due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even the most well-designed AAC devices will eventually fail as movements become unreliable. For people with brainstem stroke, ALS, and other disorders causing locked-in syndrome (LIS) or SSMI, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise as a method of enabling communication that does not rely upon speech or voluntary movement. In prior NIDCD-supported research, our BrainGate research team provided early proofs of principle of a powerful intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that decodes movement intentions directly from brain activity. This technology has allowed people to control a cursor on a computer screen for communication simply by imagining movements of their own arm. The proposed NIDCD U01 clinical research will further the development and testing of a fully implanted iBCI that could provide robust, intuitive control of industry-grade communication apps for people with LIS or SSMI. By leveraging the ongoing pilot clinical trials of the investigational BrainGate system, we aim to (1) improve the robustness and accuracy of neurally actuated point-and click, in part through the translation of neuronal activity from human premotor and motor cortex, (2) expand the number of input dimensions to tablet computers available via neural activity, allowing intended hand gesture commands to control communication apps on touch-screen tablet computers, and (3) rigorously compare the performance of the investigational BrainGate system to trial participants’ conventional AAC systems with respect to communication competence, information throughput, user preference and outcomes measures. By incorporating the feedback of six individual participants with paralysis, this feasibility trial will optimize a powerful iBCI for communication and will establish the metrics needed for a subsequent pivotal trial of a fully implanted, always-available iBCI communication system for people with SSMI. Project Narrative People with brainstem stroke, advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), or other disorders can become unable to move or speak despite being awake and alert. In this project, we seek to further translate knowledge about interpreting brain signals related to movement, and to further develop an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that could restore rapid and intuitive use of communication apps on tablet computers by people with paralysis.","Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication",9729335,U01DC017844,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem Infarctions', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Interactive Communication', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Outcome Measure', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'communication device', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'long short term memory network', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'neural implant', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'phrases', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional']",NIDCD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,837287,-0.05331720549561589
"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9605786,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,99506,-0.022106979548475174

"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,9898123,R44DA050222,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Android', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Well in self', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'social', 'sound frequency', 'success', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2019,225000,-0.030902624594952324
"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9832864,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,669616,-0.01236322636247755
"Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness Abstract Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage (OH) before onset of shock is a universally acknowledged great unmet need, and particularly important after trauma. Delays in the detection of OH are associated with a “failure to rescue” and a dramatic deterioration in prognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. While uniplex noninvasive technologies have failed to detect or diagnose complex disease states, we have demonstrated the superiority of multiplex approaches in silico. The goal of this STTR project is to develop a commercially viable optoimpedance sensor-based system that combines state-of-the-art noninvasive sensing technologies and advanced multivariable statistical algorithms. Phase I will involve three Aims: 1) D​esign, Fabricate and Test Opto-Impedance oPiic sensors, 2) Develop of Mobile App, Data and ML Pipeline on Secure Cloud, and 3) Evaluate oPiics on an Unanesthetized Upright Porcine Hemorrhage Model. By derisking the hardware challenges, we will be well-positioned for a Phase II application to optimize oPiic design and manufacturing, fold-in predictive algorithms under current development with DOD support, and validate with a clinical trial in critical care setting. Project Narrative We have demonstrated that a multiplex approach is superior to predicting shock compared to single clinical devices alone. During a mass-casualty event, a predictive tool would need to be deployed widely, since only a fraction of individuals will have ongoing hemorrhage that will progress to decompensated shock. Optical and bioimpedance signals are critical indicators of muscle hemodynamics and electrolyte balance likely to be modified in the period leading up to shock. No commercial device exists that provides continuous, low-power, low-cost monitoring of these signals with characteristics suitable for integration with the multiplexing approach. This STTR application seeks Phase I funding to commercialize an opto-impedance sensor, called the ‘oPiic’, that will address this unmet need.",Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness,9909081,R41EB029284,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber Optics', 'Funding', 'General anesthetic drugs', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolism', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electric impedance', 'electrical property', 'hemodynamics', 'instrument', 'light weight', 'mass casualty', 'member', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'optical sensor', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'response to injury', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tissue oxygenation', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,"MULTIVARIATE SYSTEMS, INC.",R41,2019,155282,-0.0019219379855998947
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,-0.024901333960038026
"Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Project Summary/Abstract  This Phase III (P-III) COBRE project will extend the cores that have been successfully leveraged in our Phase I (P-I) and Phase II (P-II) COBRE projects and sustain these unique resources in New Mexico through the im- plementation of a business plan. Over the past eight years we have built up infrastructure and created a cutting edge brain imaging center, our P-II project is just over half-way through and is even more successful than our P- I was at this point in time. The Mind Research Network (MRN) houses an Elekta Neuromag 306-channel MEG System, a high density EEG lab, a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner, and a mobile 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Additional resources include a centralized neuroinformatics system, a strong IT management plan, and state-of-the-art image analysis expertise and tools. This P-III COBRE center will continue our momentum and move the cores we have developed into a position of long term sustainability. We will continue with the technical cores established during the P-II project including multimodal data acquisition (MDA), algorithm and data analy- sis (ADA), and biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI). These cores have begun to serve MRN and the greater community, as well as other institutions including extensive collaborations with IDeA funded projects in New Mexico and other states. We believe this P-III COBRE is extremely well-positioned to establish and sustain New Mexico as one of the premier brain imaging sites. We include an extensive pilot project program (PPP) that is built on the successful pilot programs implemented as part of the earlier COBRE phases. This includes an ex- tensive educational, mentoring, and faculty development program to carefully mentor and position faculty who use the cores to maximize their potential to successfully compete for external funding, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 2 Narrative  This Phase III COBRE project is a natural extension of our Phase I and II COBRE projects which were cen- tered on mentoring individual researchers along with building the necessary infrastructure to support multimodal neuroimaging in mental illness. During this time, cutting-edge cores were developed that facilitated not only our local projects but also research at multiple institutions across New Mexico; the cores served as neuroimaging facilities and training centers for others to utilize. The Phase III project will ensure the sustainability of these cores as they transition to being fully funded by a broad cadre of users with various funding sources. We propose three technical cores including a multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core, an algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core, and a biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI) core. These cores have already shown their utility and have begun to be leveraged by users outside the COBRE. In addition, we propose a robust pilot project program (PPP) to continue to seed and enable new users of the cores to ultimately grow and sustain world class brain imaging research within our IDeA state, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 1",Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND),9700159,P30GM122734,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Mission', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'New Mexico', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'distinguished professor', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'meetings', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,P30,2019,1290517,-0.023104596446268735
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9464374,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,470142,-0.013080713620167635
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,9593999,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,293386,-0.01962083188401027
"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Phase II: Verification and validation of RESCU will be completed, culminating in third-party validation testing and certification. Finally, we will complete a clinical assessment including self-reporting subjective measures, and real-world usage metrics in a long-term clinical study. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control,9622537,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Calibration', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'empowerment', 'functional improvement', 'improved', 'innovation', 'myoelectric control', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prosthesis control', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2018,216724,0.01659637966544214
"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Summary / Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project proposes the development of an image- processing-based tool, named PostureCheck™, aimed at automatically detecting when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation exercises. The system will be based on a standard video camera (e.g., GoPro) that will be used to capture the movements of the subject.  The automatic detection of undesirable compensatory movements is especially important when patients use a rehabilitation robotic system with minimum supervision, i.e. when a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of multiple patients simultaneously. In this context, PostureCheck™ may be capable of tracking robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises and enable feedback modalities to discourage the performance of undesirable compensatory movements.  Our long-term goal is to integrate PostureCheck™ with the Barrett Upper-extremity Robotic Trainer - BURT®, which we developed with special emphasis on stroke rehabilitation. The combination of PostureCheck™ with the BURT® device would be ideally suited for deployment in “Robotic Gyms”, where a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of several patients simultaneously, thus allowing rehabilitation centers to offer high-dosage, high-intensity interventions despite the limited number of therapists currently available in the US.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we will develop PostureCheck™ to detect the most common compensatory movements automatically. To achieve this goal, we will rely on recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) methods referred to as Deep Learning. These methods have recently broken records in the human-posture analysis, joint-skeleton detection, and recognition of human activities using a single inexpensive camera. The proposed video-based PostureCheck™ tool will be the first system to exploit the capabilities of hybrid Deep Neural Networks, for real-time detection of compensatory movements during robot- assisted rehabilitation.  The proposed SBIR Phase-I activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, feedback from rehabilitation experts at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital will be used to collect video data and to label compensatory movements observed during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises by using the BURT® system. In Aim 2, Deep Learning techniques will be used to develop a robust detection of undesirable compensatory movements during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises. Finally, in Aim 3, the algorithms developed in Aim 2 will be optimized. Specifically, we will test implementations that are suitable to generate real-time feedback. Computationally efficient implementations of the algorithms will enable - in future studies - the development of new modalities of control of the rehabilitation robot with the objective of discouraging undesirable compensatory movements. Project Narrative  Each year, nearly 800,000 Americans suffer from a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and - eventually - improved function. This proposal aims to develop a novel video-based tool, named PostureCheck™, to detect undesirable compensatory movements and enable automatic corrective feedback to the patient during robot- assisted upper-limb therapy.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,9678997,R43EB027525,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Records', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Vision', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dosage', 'efficacy evaluation', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'meetings', 'monocular', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic device', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R43,2018,223752,-0.0539417433931116
"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination. The proposal utilizes five formative evaluation strategies to examine the steps required for technological adaptation and which will retain program and implementation fidelity.",Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens,9557402,R43DA046238,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consumer Preferences', 'Cost Savings', 'Cultural Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Prevention Program', 'E-learning', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based program', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Family dynamics', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Sexuality', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Speed', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral health intervention', 'child protection', 'child protective service', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'court', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'formative assessment', 'foster care', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interactive multimedia', 'mindfulness', 'preference', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'rehearsal', 'satisfaction', 'scaffold', 'service providers', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social learning', 'social media', 'social skills', 'software development', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,"STRENGTHENING FAMILIES PROGRAM, LLC",R43,2018,150054,-0.026990152416721244
"Automating Real-Time Localization of Target Sites in Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia Project Summary Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart diseases. The majority of life-threatening VT episodes are caused by an electrical ""short circuit” that travels through narrow strands of surviving tissue inside myocardial scar. Catheter ablation treats scar-related VT by “blocking” the surviving channel that forms the circuit, commonly at the site the circuit exits from the scar. To localize a VT exit, however, remains a significant challenge. A common approach, known as pace-mapping, utilizes the principle that the VT exit serves as the origin of ventricular activation and determines the QRS morphology on 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). It thus involves repetitive electrical simulation at various sites of the heart, until locating the site that reproduces the QRS of the VT on all 12 ECG leads. While the principle behind pace- mapping is time tested, the current practice is of a ""trial-and-error"" nature and requires rapid qualitative interpretation of the ECG by clinicians, which can be time-consuming and inaccurate. This research proposes to leverage modern machine learning techniques to reform the way the principle behind pace-mapping is used. It aims to learn the relationship between the origin of ventricular activation and ECG morphology, and then use it to directly predict the exit of a VT from its ECG data. To this end, this project will include the following activities: 1) to develop a population-based model to provide pre-procedural initial localizations of VT exits using standard 12-lead ECG; 2) to integrate the population-based model with a patient-specific model in clinically-usable software to provide intra-procedural real-time guidance for localizing the exit site of a clinical VT; and 3) to assess the ability of the proposed software to improve the efficiency and accuracy of pace- mapping in a prospective clinical study. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of computational and clinical scientists with a fruitful record of collaboration. The software delivered by this project will provide real-time assistance to clinicians for narrowing down a VT exit with a minimum amount of time and localization errors. This will substantially reduce the workload for ablating multiple VTs, potentially allowing clinicians to ablate more or even all VTs seen in a procedure. This may reduce the duration of an ablation procedure while improving its outcome. The development and deployment of the software also adds minimal cost or distractions to routine workflow. With a low barrier to clinical implementation, it will have a real potential to challenge and improve the standard practice of catheter ablation. Project Narrative Catheter ablation treats ventricular arrhythmia by destroying the culprit tissue responsible for the arrhythmia. To localize the culprit tissue, however, remains a tedious process with limited success in current practice. This project will develop inexpensive software to guide clinicians towards the culprit tissue in real time during the procedure, helping narrow down the ablation target with a minimum amount of time and localization errors.",Automating Real-Time Localization of Target Sites in Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia,9590857,R15HL140500,"['Ablation', 'Arrhythmia', 'Attention', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Encapsulated', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population Database', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Workload', 'clinical implementation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'distraction', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'sudden cardiac death', 'usability']",NHLBI,ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R15,2018,419810,-0.017256484457008836
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9448794,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2018,331851,-0.01506529192757029
"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calories', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietitian', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Malnutrition', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Wearable Computer', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'digital models', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'healthy lifestyle', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle factors', 'mathematical model', 'negative affect', 'programs', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,-0.005668435774950471
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources.

B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. Real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a field with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact public health. The goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical modeling frameworks for making forecasts of infectious diseases in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches,9553816,R35GM119582,"['Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modernization', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'vector control']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2018,368020,-0.030423132962934505
"Wireless Movement Sensing System for People with Severe Disabilities Abstract The ability of people with severe physical impairment to participate in family life, communication, work, or recreation is severely restricted without access to assistive technology (AT). Yet, as disability severity increases, so does the challenge to finding (1) an access movement that a person can perform to control AT and (2) an access technology that can detect the access movement. We propose to create a wireless movement sensing system that can learn a user’s access movement and then recognize that movement in order to wirelessly control assistive devices. Once we complete the technology development, we will measure the sensitivity and specificity of our wireless movement sensing system using the movements of ten people with SPI. We will present our results to AT experts during a focus group session and determine the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the technology. This Phase 1 research is proposed by a multidisciplinary research team consisting of AT engineers, AT clinicians, and a machine learning expert. Project Narrative The proposed movement sensing system adapts to the abilities of people with severe physical impairment and enables them to better control smart devices (e.g., computers, smartphones, etc.).",Wireless Movement Sensing System for People with Severe Disabilities,9554167,R43DC017791,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Android', 'Arkansas', 'Beds', 'Bluetooth', 'Brain Stem Infarctions', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Generations', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Recreation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Spinal cord injury', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Thumb structure', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'Work', 'cost', 'disability', 'effectiveness measure', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"INVOTEK, INC.",R43,2018,222217,0.0023416486606718584
"A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants Ensuring access to clean water for generations to come will involve developing novel ap- proaches to determining the safety and composition of potable water that are practical and afford- able. Arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are three of the top priorities among hazardous substances commonly found at Superfund sites, as they are linked to health problems in people exposed to them in drinking water, yet the current real-time monitoring methods for these and other contam- inants are either extremely costly or nonexistent, making it difﬁcult to monitor water quality with high spatial or temporal resolution. QBiSci is developing a biosensor that uses synthetic micro- bial sensor strains that ﬂuoresce in response to speciﬁc toxins to continuously monitor water for contamination. The platform will substantially improve upon currently available technologies for toxin detection, making monitoring more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable. Speciﬁc Aim 1: To fully characterize three synthetic E. coli strains that speciﬁcally detect ar- senic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water stream. For a real-time sensor to be maxi- mally effective, it must be able to report accurate toxin concentrations in real-time. Focusing on three of the highest priority contaminants as a proof of feasibility, comprehensive data will be acquired to train a machine learning algorithm to be able classify real-world samples in real-time. Speciﬁc Aim 2: To develop and train a classiﬁcation algorithm to recognize the type and amount of each contaminant present in a continuous water stream. The ability to analyze and interpret data in real-time from a constantly ﬂuctuating water source will require an extensive classiﬁcation train- ing effort. QBiSci's existing machine learning framework will be trained and tested using many contamination induction scenarios, ranging from sudden pulses to subtly varying concentrations. Speciﬁc Aim 3: To develop a microﬂuidic cartridge system that reduces device complexity and enables sensor deployment with minimal intervention. QBiSci will develop a swappable car- tridge system using devices that are pre-loaded with biologically-stable strains and can simply be “plugged in” to the sensor platform to achieve repeatable results in a user-friendly manner. The development of a method for thermoplastic device fabrication will enable the more precise connections required for a cartridge clamping system that will require little operational expertise.  A successful outcome of this proposal will lead to a biosensor capable of real-time quantiﬁca- tion of arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water input. A future Phase II proposal would focus on real-world performance evaluations of our sensors via deployment in areas of con- cern and comparison of our results to standard techniques as well as an expansion of the platform to detect other contaminants quantitatively and continuously. 1 Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country over 100,000 hazardous waste sites are so heavily contaminated that the un- derlying groundwater doesn't meet drinking water standards. While there is a wide range of toxins found at these sites, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are among the most common offend- ers, all of which have been linked to a variety of health problems ranging from cancer to dia- betes as well as behavior and neurological disorders. We are developing a customizable real-time biosensor that will enable contamination monitoring to become more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable and will facilitate improved management decisions aimed at reducing toxin con- centrations in the environment, tracking the progression of contamination plums, and targeting investments in remediation efforts. 1",A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants,9467134,R43ES028993,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arsenic', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Cadmium', 'Classification', 'Closure by clamp', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hazardous Substances', 'Hazardous Waste Sites', 'Health', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plug-in', 'Plum', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'contaminated water', 'cost', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'real time monitoring', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'superfund site', 'temporal measurement', 'user-friendly', 'water quality']",NIEHS,"QUANTITATIVE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,162205,-0.02734439177265289
"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9711194,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2018,99914,-0.03497395559393638
"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices.

"Device for real-time streaming of preclinical research data into a central cloud-based platform Project Summary BehaviorCloud is a unified cloud platform where biomedical researchers can collect, analyze, and share preclinical research data – specifically behavioral and phenotype data from animal models. Traditionally researchers collect data from many disparate instruments and store data on PCs running single license software. Raw data is stored across several locations, analysis is restricted to the PC used to collect the data, and opportunities for collaboration, remote-participation, and data sharing are limited. BehaviorCloud is leveraging cloud data streaming and storage to overcome these barriers to discovery. In 2017 BehaviorCloud released a first version of the underlying cloud platform as well as BehaviorCloud Camera, an open-source “reference implementation” that demonstrates automated video tracking of animal behavior on the BehaviorCloud platform using a consumer-grade smartphone. This tool and the underlying platform are both in active use across academic and pharmaceutical labs. The aim of this Phase I SBIR application is to develop patent-pending “Bridge” technology that allows data streaming from third-party instrumentation into the central web platform. Researchers will bypass the original software and PCs associated with their instruments to control trials through their BehaviorCloud account and receive data back in real-time. BehaviorCloud will provide a public repository to aggregate all of these data and accelerate discovery by providing computational tools for large-scale meta-analysis and machine learning based predictive analytics.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9503816,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'dravet syndrome', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,237423,-0.036208893183896126
"Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease 1 Abstract  2  3 This is a Phase I SBIR proposal to develop a non-contact and non-invasive imaging device for assisting clinicians  4 in selecting the appropriate level-of-amputation (LOA) in limbs with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgeons  5 prefer to salvage as much limb tissue as possible during amputation to increase patient mobility while decreasing  6 morbidity and mortality. However, clinicians must balance this preference against the likelihood of primary wound  7 healing at a given level of amputation (LOA), which decreases with more distal amputations. There are no gold-  8 standard tests to aid clinicians in selecting the LOA in patients with PAD, therefore reported rates of re-  9 amputation in current practice are substantial. Up to 20% percent of above-the-knee amputations to 35% of 10 foot amputations require revision to a more proximal level. Furthermore, physician awareness of the risk for 11 re-amputation may lead to overly aggressive selection of LOA to more proximal levels in some cases. Indeed, 12 certain patients may receive amputations at a level more proximal than is necessary because their surgeon could 13 not confidently predict a high likelihood of healing at a more distal level. 14 15 In current practice, selection of LOA is determined qualitatively by clinical judgment of the surgeon using patient 16 history and physical exam. Others have developed quantitative tests that assess local microcirculation. These 17 technologies have not superseded clinical judgement. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is 18 developing an imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging with a machine learning algorithm 19 to provide a quantitative assessment of the healing potential of a selected LOA whereas current clinical 20 practice is only capable of qualitative assessment. 21 22 We have proof-of-concept of our technology’s ability to characterize microvascular blood flow changes in a 23 patient with critical limb ischemia. In this proposal, we intend to establish the utility of our device for predicting 24 the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA by demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepView assessment 25 on a large set of pre-amputation images. To this end we will conduct a Phase I pilot study for the use of our 26 device in predicting the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA. This clinical study will develop a data set 27 for training the algorithm, and deliver a clear demonstration of feasibility for completing the development on an 28 algorithm that has high accuracy in predicting the healing potential of the proposed amputation site. Following 29 this work, we will apply for a Phase II proposal intended to finalize algorithm training, validate the algorithm 30 developed in Phase I, and establish a successful regulatory and commercialization pathway. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease,9622035,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Ankle', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Microcirculation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postoperative Period', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'commercialization', 'design', 'foot', 'healing', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'patient mobility', 'phase 1 study', 'preference', 'standard of care', 'success', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2018,196561,-0.012760379226695063
"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Companions', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Spinach - dietary', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'aptamer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'targeted biomarker']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,224925,-0.06323242175472665
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines. Beyond toxicological evaluation of therapeutic compounds, our innovative technology will deliver additional benefit to public health by virtue of its utility in investigating the toxicities of environmental chemicals, in line with the focus of government agencies and initiatives such as the EPA and Tox21 in the US and EU-ToxRisk in Europe.",Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding,9623156,R44TR002572,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug toxicity', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry Standard', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Nodal', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'cell immortalization', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'environmental chemical', 'expression vector', 'genome editing', 'high throughput screening', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phase I trial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'site-specific integration', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NCATS,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,1178386,-0.026004942236075166
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9586309,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2018,232214,-0.0023312230125281776
"An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking Project Summary/Abstract  Particle tracking (PT) is a biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena of diverse species, and rheological properties of complex materials. PT experiments involve first obtaining high resolution videos that capture time-resolved increments of particles, followed by extraction of traces of entities of interest from videos in the form of spatial locations over time, a process we refer to as path conversion. Finally, quantitative analysis of the traces will yield diffusivities, viscoelasticity, etc.  Lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, are characterized by a highly viscoelastic mucus layer that is incapable of being cleared by mucociliary clearance. Not surprisingly, the viscoelasticity of mucus often directly reflects disease progression. A variety of mucolytics are being investigated, but due to the variable composition and properties of mucus between patients, effective mucolytics treatment will likely be different between individuals; too little/inappropriate mucolytics will not be effective in restoring mucus clearance, whereas too much may result in bronchorrhea. Although microbeads-based rheology has been performed on a variety of mucus specimens in basic research, the capacity for high throughput characterization of rheological properties of biological specimens in a clinical setting is currently not available. This limitation can be attributed to inefficiencies of path conversion: current PT software requires extensive human supervision/intervention to achieve accurate path conversion, not only resulting in poor reproducibility and throughput but also restricting its use to only expert labs. Our vision is to make PT as objective and easy to use as a simple plate reader that can be readily utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening), and research professionals. Towards this goal, we have created a neural network tracker (NNT) that automatically determines the location of all particles in each frame with zero user-input (i.e. no parameter for users to change), and retains the identity of all particles from frame to frame. The innovation is that NNT can robustly, reproducibly, and accurately track a wide range of 2D/3D videos with virtually no need for human intervention, achieving unparalleled time savings. We have already successfully deployed NNT over the Google cloud, which offers exceptional scalability. Nevertheless, for time-sensitive applications, such as an automated PT rheometer, the transfer of large video data files is likely prohibitive. Therefore, in this Phase I STTR, we seek to enable real-time NNT-based PT analysis on the local machine while video microscopy data is being acquired by the microscope, and allow data from PT analysis to drive the operation of the microscope. In Aim 1, we will integrate our NNT with a single objective fluorescence microscope system called Monoptes. Aim 2 will evaluate the performance of our NNT- Monoptes system. If successful, our technology would form the basis of a fully automated PT system capable of measuring rheological properties of fluids/materials or distribution of particle sizes in a 96-well plate format. Project Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately, its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a software that can consistently provide superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. In this proposal, we will integrate this latest advance with sophisticated instrumentation to develop a microscope system capable of fully automated particle tracking microscopy in a 96-well plate format. If successful, the instrument will likely be utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening of patients), and research professionals.",An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking,9620574,R41GM130202,"['Acceleration', 'Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Screening', 'Effectiveness', 'Elasticity', 'Engineering', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'HIV Infections', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microspheres', 'Motion', 'Mucociliary Clearance', 'Mucolytics', 'Mucous body substance', 'Output', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Series', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Spottings', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Video Microscopy', 'Viscosity', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical tools', 'cloud based', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'movie', 'novel', 'operation', 'particle', 'patient screening', 'physical science', 'pre-clinical', 'submicron', 'virtual', 'viscoelasticity']",NIGMS,"AI TRACKING SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2018,224894,-0.025047271672460066
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9572928,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,1060180,-0.007610491898275909
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research PROJECT SUMMARY This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0™ that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud™ Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb’s DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9741597,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,99999,0.006435713920779625
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9682871,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,40644,-0.0022076856404553598
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9566306,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,30000,-0.0660387147742358

"Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication Intoxication from marijuana (MJ) impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated with MJ. However, there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication. Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ, THC, in body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within 15 minutes, long before impairment is resolved. And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of these metabolites can take weeks. Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood, breath or body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication. In response to this significant knowledge gap, this project aims to develop an accurate, portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a non-invasive, safe brain imaging technique that capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity. fNIRS can be performed in natural environments at low cost, and thus can be used in real-world settings. In Phase I, we will develop an algorithm for individual-level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements. To do so, we will assess the effect of oral THC (or placebo) on fNIRS measurements, self-reported intoxication, and impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) in 40 healthy MJ users. fNIRS assessments will examine (1) the effect of THC exposure on resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal cortex, (2) the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning with THC administration correlates with THC-induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety test determinants of impairment. Milestone: Should machine learning applications to the data generate an algorithm that predicts impairment with >80% accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test, we will proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will conduct fNIRS testing in 150 individuals under THC/placebo as in Phase I and in 50 individuals in a THC plus alcohol/placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with >90% specificity. It is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment. This will warrant commercialization, which will be followed by prototype development and field testing. An accurate, quantitative, biological test that is user-friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous commercial potential, as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support. The goal of this project is to develop, test, and refine a method to accurately and reliably detect marijuana (MJ) impairment using a portable, user-friendly, non-invasive, brain-based modality. MJ doubles the chance of motor vehicle accidents, yet, there now exists no valid, biologically based method to detect whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ. The development of a reliable, quantitative biological marker that enables law enforcement officers to screen individuals whom they suspect are impaired from MJ will have highly significant public health importance and enormous commercial potential.",Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication,9541180,R42DA043977,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Body Fluids', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Driving While Intoxicated', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Oral', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychomotor Impairments', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'THC exposure', 'Testing', 'Tetrahydrocannabinol', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vendor', 'absorption', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavior test', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'density', 'detector', 'driving under influence', 'drug testing', 'field sobriety tests', 'field study', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'interest', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,"HIGHLIGHTI, INC",R42,2018,731789,-0.005187239652740873

"Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing. Project Summary/Abstract.  Life on Earth evolved to take time cues from the Sun. Consequently, most or all cells in the mammalian body use genetic feedback loops to time their daily (circadian) rhythms. When a person or any mammal sees light, that winds an orchestrating circadian brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN in turn helps keep the myriad other tissue and endocrine rhythms in synchrony, enabling health. The modern environment is highly disruptive to this internal synchrony. Light at night from cell phones or urban light pollution, and social impositions like school start times or rotating work shifts all act as “temporal pollution,” causing loss of internal synchrony. The more severe the desynchrony, the higher the risk for a broad range of diseases, including obesity, cancer, infertility, depression and ultimately cognitive decline. Without knowing how these systems normally maintain synchrony or which systems are normally synchronized, it is hard to understand what happens in desynchrony to degrade health. This problem is complicated by the fact that some biological systems have ultradian (every few hours) and infradian (every few days) cycles in addition to circadian cycles. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) generates ultradian rhythms through negative feedback, but also shows a strong circadian cycle; the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) shows the same negative feedback ultradian activity, circadian rhythmicity, and also infradian rhythms of ovulation and spermatogenesis. These two axes are regulated by the SCN. Recent work indicates that there is cross-talk between these axes, and that their hormonal outputs - corticosterone, and estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males), respectively – work to synchronize extra-SCN tissues and behavioral rhythms of feeding and drinking (FaD). Finally, the SCN, HPA, and HPG axes all affect core body temperature (CBT), so that high temporal resolution recordings of CBT contain information about the cycling and synchrony of these systems across time scales.  There are three aims to this proposal, using rats as a model system: 1) Test at high temporal resolution the effects of changes to the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN on CBT. 2) Use these relationships to build a model that can back-predict the state of the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN from a high temporal resolution CBT record of a given individual. 3) Expose rats to environmental temporal disruption in the form of a 6 h “jetlag” phase advance of the light cycle, and use the model to predict the response across these systems at 1-minute temporal resolution. This work will employ within-animal comparisons before and after surgical and pharmacological manipulations of rats whose FaD, activity, and CBT are captured continuously at 1-minute resolution. These data will be analyzed using signal-processing and machine learning to define patterns and relationships. The resulting model will allow minimally-invasive exploration of environmental disruption across physiological systems in real time. The model will be used to quantify synchrony as it is disrupted and re-emerges, identifying markers for risk or resilience, and generating hypotheses for future work into preventive strategies and treatments. Project Narrative. Artificial lights and social obligation cause people living with modern infrastructure to suffer a loss of synchrony across their organs, which evolved to track the stable day and year light cycles. We know about internal synchrony mostly by the diseases that arise from its loss – everything from cancer to obesity, depression, and infertility. This work will develop a system for tracking the cycles of many body-systems at the same time with minute-to-minute accuracy, allowing rapid detection of desynchrony, and a potential way to study how synchrony works normally, and why its disruption by the modern environment causes disease.",Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing.,9567170,K99ES027509,"['Address', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Body Temperature', 'Body Temperature Changes', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Corticosterone', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'Dyspepsia', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Estradiol', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Jet Lag Syndrome', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Ovulation', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Planet Earth', 'Pollution', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Obligations', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'comparative', 'drinking', 'feeding', 'high risk', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'minimally invasive', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid detection', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'shift work', 'signal processing', 'social', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'time use']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2018,104094,-0.04950724038721983
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9503015,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2018,664486,-0.015295467674620042
"Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations Abstract The Simulation System for Emission Tomography (SimSET) is one of the foundational tools for emission tomography research, used by hundreds of researchers worldwide for both positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It has proven to be accurate and efficient for both PET and low energy SPECT studies; because SimSET uses a geometric model for its SPECT collimation, it is less accurate for high energy isotopes. This application proposes to address this with the use of angular response functions (ARFs), a technique that has proven to accurately model SPECT collimation and detection for high-energy isotopes more efficiently than full photon-tracking simulations. In addition, we propose a novel ARF-based importance sampling method that will speed these simulations by a factor of >50. The generation of ARF tables is another consideration: it is extremely compute intensive and has caused ARF to be used only when a large number of simulations are needed using the same isotope/collimator/detector combination. For this reason, we also propose application of importance sampling to speed the generation of ARF tables by a factor 5, and the creation of a library of angular response functions for popular isotope/collimator/detector combinations. The former will lessen the computational cost of generating the tables, the latter will, for many users/uses, eliminate the need to generate ARF tables at all. This will greatly expand the potential applications of ARF-based simulations. Our first aim is to accelerate SimSET SPECT simulations without sacrificing accuracy. This will be accomplished by synergistically utilizing two tools: variance reduction and angular response function (ARF) tables. Variance reduction includes importance sampling and forced detection. We hypothesis that these techniques combined with information from our angular response function tables will improve SimSET simulation efficiency by >50 times of SPECT simulations of specific radioisotopes (e.g., I-123, Y-90, etc.). Our second aim is to accelerate ARF table generation. This will be accomplished by using importance sampling methods in the generation of ARFs. We further propose to use an adaptive stratification scheme that will simulate photons for a given table position only as long as required to determine its value to a user-specified precision. Our third aim is to create a library of pre-calculated ARF tables for popular vendor isotope/collimator/detector configurations. These ARF tables will then be made publically available for download through the SimSET website. With a registered user base of >500, we believe that these enhancements to SimSET will have far reaching impact on research projects throughout the world. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop methods to speed up the SimSET Monte Carlo-based simulation software for single photon computed tomography (SPECT) imaging systems by greater than 50-fold. This type of speed up with enable new research that was previously impractical due to the computation time required for simulation. In addition, all software tools and tables developed within this project will be made available via a web-based host.",Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations,9583854,R03EB026800,"['90Y', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Collimator', 'Communities', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Industrialization', 'Institution', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Photons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radioisotopes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vendor', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cost', 'detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'response', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'synergism', 'thallium-doped sodium iodide', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R03,2018,74515,-0.014902005981746085
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9455026,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,263805,-0.021489359722821597
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9547897,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,317404,-0.013075832622588929

"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets.

"Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery. These are high priority objectives of the partner institutions in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia and align with the objective of CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria of the Center for Global Health to refine malaria interventions and develop new tools to stay ahead of the curve and ensure its global investments continue to be successful.",Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,9548467,U01GH001646,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2018,161021,-0.018052595920824095
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9681835,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,576678,-0.03393754261239094
"Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery. These are high priority objectives of the partner institutions in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia and align with the objective of CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria of the Center for Global Health to refine malaria interventions and develop new tools to stay ahead of the curve and ensure its global investments continue to be successful.",Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,9692304,U01GH001646,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2018,100000,-0.018052595920824095
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9442751,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2018,673206,-0.004389109450115716

"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9596236,R01HD094772,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Artificial Leg', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Degree program', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Environment', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'orthotics', 'powered prosthesis', 'programs', 'prosthesis control', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'success', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2018,474602,0.003406462629834729
"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9506810,R44HL127843,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Europe', 'Formulation', 'Glutathione', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospital Costs', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'State Hospitals', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'model design', 'novel', 'open innovation', 'oxidative damage', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'programs', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'wasting']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,428727,-0.0121018412823281
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9538823,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,167319,-0.029930732284324
"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9638443,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2018,30197,-0.011302466899958202
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce. This year’s symposium will focus issues related to return of genomic results in both clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations.",Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)?,9612854,R13HG010286,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acceleration', 'African American', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuing Education', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'frontier', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health information technology', 'incentive program', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'multiple omics', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'senior faculty', 'symposium', 'trend']",NHGRI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R13,2018,10000,-0.024017484659301265
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9483579,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2018,249000,-0.03140635768448845
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Development and feasibility of prevention-minded oral health mobile App based on dietary selections and oral hygiene events. The number of decayed and filled tooth surfaces in primary dentition is on the rise in US children between the ages of 2 and 11 years old; in fact, 60% of adolescents (between 12 and 19 years old) and 9 out of 10 dentate seniors (age 65+) bear evidence of dental caries. Reinforced with a 2011-12 report stating 91% of those between the ages of 20 and 64 have dental caries, virtually all walks of life are thus affected – and this doesn’t even include those unreported, or those with significant dental erosion or gingival recession. Thus, these statistics could imply there is a significant unmet need in creating improved mechanisms for healthier dietary and hygienic habits. One way to achieve healthier habits and behavior is through effective communication. However, disconnects exist between oral health messaging and the patient’s understanding of clinical recommendations: in fact, oral health organizations recognize the need to improve and empower the public’s oral health literacy. Although adherence to preventive plans are critical to thwarting tooth decay, a patient’s poor oral health understanding and knowledge, even after a dental visit, persistently introduce factors that diminish preventive efforts and favorable oral health outcomes: for example, a clinical report revealed the average patient only recounts about half of the recommended dental advice. Oral health literacy is a relatively new area of research and there are few innovations in this space. Therefore, opportunities that address oral health illiteracy and behavioral barriers utilizing today’s 21st century technology may promote better oral health outcomes. Such approaches are already well-under way for systemic health, but thus far, prevention-minded oral health measures are lacking. We believe a unique approach exists that utilizes something most people, both young and old, access on a daily basis: a mobile device. Our approach is underlined by recent statistics released by the Pew Center: more than 8 out of 10 U.S. adults access mobile devices for information, including more than 67% of seniors (65+ years of age). Utilizing our proven strengths and successes in preventive dentistry innovations and mobile application (App) development, in this Phase I proposal we will determine feasibility of creating a prototype oral health App that scores dietary and oral hygiene events utilizing algorithms devised from libraries of empirical nutritional and scientific data (laboratory and clinical). In doing so, this Phase I proposal has three Specific Aims: empirical nutritional and scientific data mining; multi-tiered decision tree algorithm construction with putative scoring index based on Aim #1 data; and, development of a prototype mobile App based on Aims #1 and #2. If successful and with clinical testing expected in a Phase II proposal, the long-term goal of this research is to deploy and commercialize an oral health App that promotes clinically effective oral health behavior. The constant feed from mined data libraries and social-engineering aspects are expected to drive routine use of the App, thus engaging the user towards favorable habits and healthier outcomes.

"Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will result in a set of validated survey questions for distinguishing Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It will also produce validated survey-based and EHR-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. T1DM and T2DM are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that CDC relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. It is important for surveillance systems to be able to distinguish diabetes type to support type-specific analyses of morbidity, mortality, medical care costs, and health-related quality of life. Improved surveillance data by diabetes type can help guide and monitor federal, state, and local diabetes programs, enrich diabetes research, and support people with diabetes.",Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes,9542094,U01DP006327,[' '],NCCDPHP,"WESTAT, INC.",U01,2018,499828,-0.016562506175162462
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments. This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel automated method for fitting hearing aids based on real-time speech perception performance. This automated approach can improve hearing aid success while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II,9472306,R44DC016249,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Automation', 'Businesses', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Service delivery model', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'graph theory', 'health care service', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inclusion criteria', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R44,2018,732079,-0.07976820665252932
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning; however, these props are fundamentally limited.",Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers,9622753,R44GM130247,"['Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'animation', 'career', 'college', 'commercialization', 'design', 'digital media', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'mid-career faculty', 'pedagogy', 'prototype', 'retention rate', 'science education', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2018,224984,0.007789937532786681

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9558429,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2018,825561,-0.02569291431834261
"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9458539,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2018,99506,-0.022106979548475174
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9519046,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2018,620198,-0.009323741822656991
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,-0.024901333960038026
"Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Project Summary/Abstract  This Phase III (P-III) COBRE project will extend the cores that have been successfully leveraged in our Phase I (P-I) and Phase II (P-II) COBRE projects and sustain these unique resources in New Mexico through the im- plementation of a business plan. Over the past eight years we have built up infrastructure and created a cutting edge brain imaging center, our P-II project is just over half-way through and is even more successful than our P- I was at this point in time. The Mind Research Network (MRN) houses an Elekta Neuromag 306-channel MEG System, a high density EEG lab, a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner, and a mobile 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Additional resources include a centralized neuroinformatics system, a strong IT management plan, and state-of-the-art image analysis expertise and tools. This P-III COBRE center will continue our momentum and move the cores we have developed into a position of long term sustainability. We will continue with the technical cores established during the P-II project including multimodal data acquisition (MDA), algorithm and data analy- sis (ADA), and biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI). These cores have begun to serve MRN and the greater community, as well as other institutions including extensive collaborations with IDeA funded projects in New Mexico and other states. We believe this P-III COBRE is extremely well-positioned to establish and sustain New Mexico as one of the premier brain imaging sites. We include an extensive pilot project program (PPP) that is built on the successful pilot programs implemented as part of the earlier COBRE phases. This includes an ex- tensive educational, mentoring, and faculty development program to carefully mentor and position faculty who use the cores to maximize their potential to successfully compete for external funding, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 2 Narrative  This Phase III COBRE project is a natural extension of our Phase I and II COBRE projects which were cen- tered on mentoring individual researchers along with building the necessary infrastructure to support multimodal neuroimaging in mental illness. During this time, cutting-edge cores were developed that facilitated not only our local projects but also research at multiple institutions across New Mexico; the cores served as neuroimaging facilities and training centers for others to utilize. The Phase III project will ensure the sustainability of these cores as they transition to being fully funded by a broad cadre of users with various funding sources. We propose three technical cores including a multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core, an algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core, and a biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI) core. These cores have already shown their utility and have begun to be leveraged by users outside the COBRE. In addition, we propose a robust pilot project program (PPP) to continue to seed and enable new users of the cores to ultimately grow and sustain world class brain imaging research within our IDeA state, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 1",Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND),9281577,P30GM122734,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Mission', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'New Mexico', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'distinguished professor', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'meetings', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,P30,2018,1320387,-0.023104596446268735
"Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the gold standard for treating acute pain following major thoracic and abdominal surgeries and in patients with fractured ribs. Of the 51 million inpatient surgeries performed in the US each year, an estimated 3 - 6 million are eligible for TEA. Multiple randomized control trials have demonstrated significantly improved patient outcomes when receiving TEA instead of systemic opioids, including reduced 90-day mortality (3.1 vs 4.9%), improved postoperative pain control, reduced pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, and reduced incidence of chronic pain syndromes. In addition, TEA is associated with increased patient satisfaction, shortened hospital stays, and a significant reduction in the cost of perioperative care (e.g. savings between $4,675 - $22,000 per patient vs systemic opioids). However, TEA is regarded as one of the most technically difficult procedures executed by anesthesiologists, in large part because epidural needle placement is guided by manual palpation of spinal bone landmarks followed by “blind” needle insertion. Palpation of spine landmarks is unreliable for identifying the epidural space (i.e. 30% accuracy) and results in high TEA failure rates (15 – 35%) due to catheter misplacement outside of the intended epidural space. Halving the number of TEA failures per year is estimated to reduce the number of postoperative deaths by 25,000 per year and result in a $15.5B/yr economic benefit due to reduced cost of care and fewer premature deaths.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of a low-cost, handheld ultrasound system and new automated image guidance technologies was demonstrated by imaging in vitro thoracic spine phantoms and human thoracic spines. This Phase II proposal seeks funding to support the continued development of a low-cost, handheld medical device for thoracic epidural guidance. The key technological innovations of this project are focused on improvements to ultrasound-based beamforming for enhanced bone visualization and include a new spinal bone imaging approach that enables the automatic detection of spinal bone landmarks and needle insertion site. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement in the postoperative patient population, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.  The Phase II hypothesis is that the handheld medical imaging device and associated technologies increases first-attempt epidural analgesia success rates, defined as successful epidural administration on the first needle insertion attempt. New ultrasound beamforming technologies for a low-channel count ultrasound transducer design for improved bone imaging performance will be designed, fabricated, and tested. In addition, ultrasound imaging technologies central to this project will be optimized, integrated into the new device, and validated in a clinical study. Finally, the Phase II hypothesis will be directly tested in an 80 patient clinical study. With an estimated 3 – 6 million patients eligible for thoracic epidural administration each year, the estimated US market size for the proposed device is $325 M/yr. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thoracic epidural analgesia is the current standard of care for postoperative pain management following thoracic or abdominal surgery. Failures occur at high rates due to a reliance on manual palpation of bone landmarks to guide needle placement, which results in numerous adverse events: incomplete analgesia, increased mortality, higher pain scores, headache, dural puncture, back pain, parathesia, and paralysis. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.",Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance,9475793,R44GM123791,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute Pain', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back Pain', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Assisted', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Epidural Analgesia', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Headache', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Needles', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain management', 'Palpation', 'Paralysed', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative Care', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Puncture procedure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Rib Fractures', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Spinal', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic epidural analgesia', 'Time', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'bone visualization', 'care costs', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'contrast enhanced', 'control trial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidural space', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'imaging approach', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inpatient surgery', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pain score', 'patient population', 'portability', 'premature', 'standard of care', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RIVANNA MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2018,793271,-0.1269836524503459
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9290961,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,441204,-0.013080713620167635

"Machine Learning-Based Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of quadriplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine Learning-Based Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation,9436952,R56NS096064,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R56,2017,371219,-0.02033754936216893
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

Charles River Analytics and our partners at Massachusetts General Hospital and Virtual Reality Medical Center propose to design and demonstrate Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On-Demand Treatment (CESSATION). We will build VR environments using our in-house game engine and content (cues) that are diverse, realistic, and well-placed, bolstering traditional psychological therapy delivery, and use research-based principles of narrative and game design to produce immersive and engaging content to motivate continued use. We will use probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian networks) and machine-learning (e.g., neural nets) to learn from patient data and clinician input to assist in selecting and combining therapies in a way that is tailored to the individual patient. Finally, CESSATION will communicate information to clinicians in a manner that is understandable, and gives them enough meta-information to foster appropriate trust in the system.

"Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mm Hg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age to affect 65% of seniors. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long- term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring blood pressure at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for these three activities with the help of new technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens, and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California - San Diego community. The product to be developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones, which incorporates financial and targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific “mental accounts” to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The approach is to (1) Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers, support self-efficacy, and complement intrinsic motivators, and (2) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP. The telehealth innovation centers on (a) Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement to establish behaviors, (b) Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time and effort costs of adherence, and finally (c) Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans, providers and researchers. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population within the UCSD Health system, additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes (e.g., achievement of BP < 140/90 mm Hg) to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to treatment for high blood pressure in the aging population is an urgent public health concern that impacts individuals, families, and communities across the nation. The resulting health problems, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, and death, and excessive spending, can be relieved through enhanced remote support for behavioral change using low-cost, scalable, and widely accessible telehealth tools, such as the product of this STTR. This approach has the potential to become widely adopted by health plans and providers that care for millions of seniors with poorly controlled hypertension to help these populations avoid complications and achieve better their health, as well as contribute to a better understanding of human behaviors and their impact on medical conditions.",Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change,9345760,R41AG056184,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Employment', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Planning', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvelinus', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'beneficiary', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'dual eligible', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability']",NIA,"WELLTH, INC.",R41,2017,223743,-0.018262913071963507
"User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices Hearing aids are the principal tool today for ameliorating age-related hearing loss and its significant social, cognitive and functional costs to patients and society at large. However, many individuals who are prescribed hearing aids do not use them at all, or use them only occasionally. Most reasons behind the “hearing aid in the drawer” phenomenon relate to the characteristics of the sound produced, and could, in theory, be addressed with the correct signal processing strategy. The problem persists despite the increased complexity and power of new devices, for three reasons: (a) The hearing aid parameters, as set in the clinic, introduce distortion or render audible many sounds that the hearing impaired user had become accustomed to not hearing. The novelty is often so uncomfortable for the user as to discard the device. (b) The optimum parameters vary depending on the listening task and environment. Under some conditions, a device with parameters designed for a different condition will perform worse than no device at all. (c) The clinical fitting is derived from a non-ideal way to assess auditory function (the pure- tone audiogram). The optimum parameters for the actual impairment may be different from those of the prescribed fitting. Although it is true that the physiological mechanisms make it impossible to process sound so as to completely reverse the effect of sensorineural hearing loss, a device that delivers some benefit at all times is likely to be used all the time. The goal is to develop a hearing aid that can adaptively change its parameters to address the problems above, and will be accomplished with a novel fitting approach that rapidly presents a number of parameter settings to the user and lets the user guide the system toward the optimal settings for each listening situation. This requires the development of machine-learning algorithms to effectively search the parameter space and user interface devices and instructions that are easy for the patient to use. The focus of this Phase I proposal is the development of the algorithms and the adaptive user-driven fitting program, and to compare the proposed fitting with the traditional audiogram-based fitting across measures of functional hearing (ability to recognize speech in noise) and subjective preference. A hearing aid user is often dissatisfied with the sound quality of their device, despite its sophistication and adjustment by a trained audiologist. The problem can be mitigated by letting the user fine-tune the device for maximum comfort in everyday use. We will apply modern machine learning methods to develop a program for efficient user-driven fitting of hearing assistive devices.",User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices,9409910,R43DC016251,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Back', 'Books', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Presbycusis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,"CARAWAY SOFTWARE, INC.",R43,2017,224966,-0.003795062524430545
"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9312420,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2017,200225,-0.03497395559393638
"Policy Surveillance: the Future of Scientific Legal Mapping. “Policy surveillance” is the “ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of information about a given body of public health law and policy” (Chriqui, O'Connor, and Chaloupka 2011). Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws; it can also increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported the development of policy surveillance programs, through NIAAA’s Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) and the National Cancer Institute’s CLASS. More recently, NIDA has funded the launch of two policy surveillance programs, the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (PDAPS) and the Drug Abuse Policy System (DAPS). CDC has been increasing its support for policy surveillance activities, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded a Policy Surveillance Program to provide methodological and technical assistance, and maintain LawAtlas.org, a general health policy surveillance portal. As more and more researchers and consumers enter the field — from the state, federal and international levels and in private industry — harmonization of terms, methodological standards, and consensus on any needed governance mechanisms is valuable to ensure continued growth and adoption of this important scientific process and its valuable products. To meet these needs, we propose to convene one conference of 30-35 invited attendees who represent the practice’s primary stakeholders from across research, technology and practice; develop, publish and disseminate at least one report that summarizes the discussion and consensus reached among attendees; and establish a one-year plan of collaborative work towards further cooperation and cohesion. Project Narrative Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws, can increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations to improve health.

"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.

"ISPW8 Conference: Designing the next generation of closed loop seizure control Project Summary The overall objective of this effort is to convene “ISPW8: Designing the next generation of closed loop seizure control”, that will take place August 20-23, 2017 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. This conference is the next in a series of seizure prediction workshops that started in 2002, and has become the premier international venue for quantitative epilepsy research. The goal of this upcoming meeting is to focus on the development of all stages of a next-generation seizure control device. The first day will have two didactic sessions, one focusing on the clinical aspects of epilepsy, the other on Big Data analytic techniques. The body of the conference will be organized around themes motivated by the three stages of closed loop intervention: 1) input: sensing and biomarkers, 2) processing: system analysis, 3) output: intervention. The theme of the second day of will be on multimodal sensors and biomarkers of epilepsy, focused especially on developing new technology. The theme of the third day will be on utilizing advanced machine learning, statistics, and computational models, to understand and characterize the large datasets from high resolution technology. The final day will be on novel interventions and control theory: new strategies for implantable anti-seizure interventions and methods for optimizing them, as well as implementation into closed loop control devices. “Provocative sessions” at the end of each day will focus on unpublished research and hypotheses followed by discussion and debate. Through this conference we aim to build bridges between the many disciplines that comprise this unique field: theoretical, computational, experimental, clinical, and industry, while also preparing the next wave of young researchers. The overall goal is to develop improved quantitative methods to predict, quantify, characterize, and control seizures. NIH funding is sought for travel support to encourage US participation. Project Relevance/Project Narrative We plan to convene an international meeting to address questions at the intersection of clinical neurophysiology, engineering, computational and epilepsy neuroscience using emerging technologies and quantitative methods.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,-0.036208893183896126

"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9357585,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,300665,-0.053301115359823806
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,9358722,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'arm function', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,865006,-0.009852738428696139
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9323604,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'pediatric department', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,1500000,-0.02948545029634423
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9360609,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,457885,-0.007610491898275909
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9354497,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2017,739402,0.007166484384966821
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health.

"All of Us, Wisconsin Our application for OT-PM-16-003, “One in a Million – Precision Medicine Initiative Wisconsin” represents the collaborative efforts of three fully integrated regional healthcare systems to form a virtual state-wide integrated delivery network. The application originates at the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), one of the most productive and earliest adopters of what has become Precision Medicine. The work of the MCHS has been cited by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins as a model for the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). To ensure comprehensive nearly state-wide coverage of participant health care, MCHS has partnered with the other academic integrated delivery networks in Wisconsin, (University of Wisconsin (UW) and Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)), that together include 173 clinics, 13 hospitals, insurer partners and 5 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The Blood Center of Wisconsin (BCW) also partners to operate state-wide mobile units of staff and equipment for blood collection that may be purposed for this effort. Through an independent agreement with Aurora Health, the electronic health records of participants recruited by academic and FQHC sites will be made available, ensuring nearly complete coverage of health care records across an entire state, with special emphasis on those populations that are traditionally the most underserved and understudied. The academic sites and FQHC partners have a long history of research cooperation and robust community engagement demonstrated by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) ties, the Wisconsin Genome Initiative, reciprocal IRB arrangements, multiple joint grants and other collaborative studies. We have pioneered and implemented data sharing platforms and have demonstrated their usefulness with numerous high impact publications over many years. All three academic centers are leaders in the details of community engagement, recruitment, tracking, return of results and data sharing across various platforms in national and international consortia using large cohorts (e.g., MCHS’s 20,000 participant Personalized Medicine Research Project). A major innovation of this application is that it aligns the major healthcare systems of an entire state to more fully capture each participant’s data wherever participants get their health care. Indeed, 80% of all health care in Wisconsin is captured by our footprint. The State-wide catchment area also includes the oldest, sickest and poorest regions in the US and represent rural and urban areas, including African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, all represented as community champions. Through the FQHC partners, the recruiting institutions will achieve the 40% African American, Hispanic and Native American participant rate, with long standing community engagement and history of successful recruitment, including Wisconsin’s 12 Native American Tribes. Lending active support are Community Champions and Community Advisory Boards. A second innovative approach will employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize recruitment and retention processes. Our scientists have long collaborated on efforts to enhance the breadth and reliability of information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), using a range of data to identify elements including family pedigrees or the occurrence of clinical events that are susceptible to unreliable coding. These efforts employed state-of-the-art methods including random forests, support vector machines and statistical relational learning, among others. These advanced computational methods will be used to predict those who are most likely to participate and which methods of approach are most effective. A third innovative approach is the planned use of mobile recruitment labs, previously successful with the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). SHOW, began in 2008 provides a novel infrastructure for population health research recruitment, enabling engagement across the state, longitudinal follow-up of participants and community-specific studies. Key assets of SHOW are two mobile units staffed by research and healthcare professionals to facilitate on-site health studies in randomly selected or community-specific participants. SHOW is predicated on community engagement and the response rate has been outstanding (in one study more than 90% of ~4,000 participants consented to follow-up, DNA testing, or blood work). This is true across all racial/ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. The fourth innovative approach is to work with our FQHC partners to recruit traditionally underserved populations. MCHS, UW and MCW will work with FQHC partners (Marshfield Family Health Center, Access Community Health Center, Milwaukee Health Services, Progressive Health Center and 16th Street Community Health Center). Importantly, we are ready to start. We have already informed and engaged our communities through press releases and newsletters. Processes are in place. Volunteers have already asked us to contact them. All the required personnel are trained and SOPs are in place to begin recruitment. We have a productive history of working with partners already funded for PMI cohort recruitment. For several years, we have worked closely (and published) with our colleagues at Northwestern and Columbia through the eMERGE Network and with the University of Pittsburgh through CTSA. Project Director Murray Brilliant has recently served as an advisor to the University of Arizona’s Precision Medicine Program. Thus, we are team-players who are ready, willing and able to be valuable collaborative partners in the effort to build a national engine to transform healthcare under PMI. n/a","All of Us, Wisconsin",9512099,OT2OD025286,"['African American', 'Agreement', 'Arizona', 'Award', 'Blood', 'Catchment Area', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consent', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Surveys', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Newsletter', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Press Releases', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic pedigree', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'rural area', 'urban area', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",OD,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,OT2,2017,5360833,-0.017963720493823426
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9340389,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2017,30000,-0.0660387147742358

"Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication Intoxication from marijuana (MJ) impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated with MJ. However, there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication. Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ, THC, in body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within 15 minutes, long before impairment is resolved. And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of these metabolites can take weeks. Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood, breath or body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication. In response to this significant knowledge gap, this project aims to develop an accurate, portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a non-invasive, safe brain imaging technique that capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity. fNIRS can be performed in natural environments at low cost, and thus can be used in real-world settings. In Phase I, we will develop an algorithm for individual-level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements. To do so, we will assess the effect of oral THC (or placebo) on fNIRS measurements, self-reported intoxication, and impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) in 40 healthy MJ users. fNIRS assessments will examine (1) the effect of THC exposure on resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal cortex, (2) the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning with THC administration correlates with THC-induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety test determinants of impairment. Milestone: Should machine learning applications to the data generate an algorithm that predicts impairment with >80% accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test, we will proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will conduct fNIRS testing in 150 individuals under THC/placebo as in Phase I and in 50 individuals in a THC plus alcohol/placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with >90% specificity. It is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment. This will warrant commercialization, which will be followed by prototype development and field testing. An accurate, quantitative, biological test that is user-friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous commercial potential, as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support. The goal of this project is to develop, test, and refine a method to accurately and reliably detect marijuana (MJ) impairment using a portable, user-friendly, non-invasive, brain-based modality. MJ doubles the chance of motor vehicle accidents, yet, there now exists no valid, biologically based method to detect whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ. The development of a reliable, quantitative biological marker that enables law enforcement officers to screen individuals whom they suspect are impaired from MJ will have highly significant public health importance and enormous commercial potential.",Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication,9334516,R42DA043977,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Body Fluids', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breath Tests', 'Cannabis', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Driving While Intoxicated', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Oral', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychomotor Impairments', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'THC exposure', 'Testing', 'Tetrahydrocannabinol', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vendor', 'absorption', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavior test', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'density', 'detector', 'driving under influence', 'drug testing', 'field sobriety tests', 'field study', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'interest', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,"HIGHLIGHTI, INC",R42,2017,224973,-0.005187239652740873
"Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing. Project Summary/Abstract.  Life on Earth evolved to take time cues from the Sun. Consequently, most or all cells in the mammalian body use genetic feedback loops to time their daily (circadian) rhythms. When a person or any mammal sees light, that winds an orchestrating circadian brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN in turn helps keep the myriad other tissue and endocrine rhythms in synchrony, enabling health. The modern environment is highly disruptive to this internal synchrony. Light at night from cell phones or urban light pollution, and social impositions like school start times or rotating work shifts all act as “temporal pollution,” causing loss of internal synchrony. The more severe the desynchrony, the higher the risk for a broad range of diseases, including obesity, cancer, infertility, depression and ultimately cognitive decline. Without knowing how these systems normally maintain synchrony or which systems are normally synchronized, it is hard to understand what happens in desynchrony to degrade health. This problem is complicated by the fact that some biological systems have ultradian (every few hours) and infradian (every few days) cycles in addition to circadian cycles. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) generates ultradian rhythms through negative feedback, but also shows a strong circadian cycle; the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) shows the same negative feedback ultradian activity, circadian rhythmicity, and also infradian rhythms of ovulation and spermatogenesis. These two axes are regulated by the SCN. Recent work indicates that there is cross-talk between these axes, and that their hormonal outputs - corticosterone, and estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males), respectively – work to synchronize extra-SCN tissues and behavioral rhythms of feeding and drinking (FaD). Finally, the SCN, HPA, and HPG axes all affect core body temperature (CBT), so that high temporal resolution recordings of CBT contain information about the cycling and synchrony of these systems across time scales.  There are three aims to this proposal, using rats as a model system: 1) Test at high temporal resolution the effects of changes to the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN on CBT. 2) Use these relationships to build a model that can back-predict the state of the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN from a high temporal resolution CBT record of a given individual. 3) Expose rats to environmental temporal disruption in the form of a 6 h “jetlag” phase advance of the light cycle, and use the model to predict the response across these systems at 1-minute temporal resolution. This work will employ within-animal comparisons before and after surgical and pharmacological manipulations of rats whose FaD, activity, and CBT are captured continuously at 1-minute resolution. These data will be analyzed using signal-processing and machine learning to define patterns and relationships. The resulting model will allow minimally-invasive exploration of environmental disruption across physiological systems in real time. The model will be used to quantify synchrony as it is disrupted and re-emerges, identifying markers for risk or resilience, and generating hypotheses for future work into preventive strategies and treatments. Project Narrative. Artificial lights and social obligation cause people living with modern infrastructure to suffer a loss of synchrony across their organs, which evolved to track the stable day and year light cycles. We know about internal synchrony mostly by the diseases that arise from its loss – everything from cancer to obesity, depression, and infertility. This work will develop a system for tracking the cycles of many body-systems at the same time with minute-to-minute accuracy, allowing rapid detection of desynchrony, and a potential way to study how synchrony works normally, and why its disruption by the modern environment causes disease.",Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing.,9386306,K99ES027509,"['Address', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Body Temperature', 'Body Temperature Changes', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Corticosterone', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'Dyspepsia', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Estradiol', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Jet Lag Syndrome', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Ovulation', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Planet Earth', 'Pollution', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Obligations', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'comparative', 'drinking', 'feeding', 'high risk', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'minimally invasive', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid detection', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'shift work', 'signal processing', 'social', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'time use']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,98712,-0.04950724038721983
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9269122,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2017,725442,-0.015295467674620042
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9288629,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,313412,-0.013075832622588929
"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9407137,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2017,159267,-0.011311096782521401

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9284636,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2017,566219,-0.004389109450115716
"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9347295,R44HL127843,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Preservation', 'Blood', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Europe', 'Formulation', 'Glutathione', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospital Costs', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'State Hospitals', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'model design', 'novel', 'open innovation', 'oxidative damage', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'wasting']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,1099022,-0.0121018412823281
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,-0.0032724801177917047
"Active Power Exoskeleton Device for Spinal Cord Injury ! ABSTRACT Significance: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) cause costly and morbid chronic conditions such as lack of voluntary movement, increased chance of pressure sores, problematic spasticity, loss of bowel, bladder, and sexual function, and more physical impairments which result in a lower quality of life and lack of independence. Approximately 285,000 people in the U.S. have SCI with ~17,000 new patients added each year. Current treatment options include an array of electrical stimulation interventions or high-intensity fitness regimens, but all share one common limitation of being episodic in their treatment delivery. There is a compelling need for a treatment option that can be used daily, improves Activities of Daily Living (ADL’s), allows for in- home rehab and most importantly provides patient independence. Enabling technology exists, often proven in other medical device applications, that can facilitate the design of an upper limb orthotic system to deliver the functional performance required by SCI patients. The OlympEX Medical Actively Powered Exoskeleton (APEX) device can meet the functional movement requirements, will be designed for in-home use and be affordable to the user. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the APEX orthotic system will achieve clinically meaningful improvement in a SCI patient’s range of motion (ROM) capability to perform ADL’s and to perform upper limb rehab in an in-home setting. Preliminary Work: The APEX orthotic system will be the third generation of orthotic device system to be developed by OlympEX Medical. Generations 1 and 2 are passively powered device systems that have provided the OlympEX design engineering team experience with mechanical apparatus requirements to elevate an upper limb. Likewise, the team has developed capabilities in advanced materials for the body chassis for these devices. The APEX orthotic system evolves from these product platforms to introduce system features in device guidance and user control only obtainable with an actively powered system. Specific Aims: This project entails the APEX hardware/electronic architecture development and the acute pre-clinical evaluation of the system on N=3 patients to evaluate patient safety and device feasibility. In Specific Aim 1 we will design, fabricate and evaluate the APEX mechanical design with electronic architecture. A subset of the APEX functional arm movements will be developed to demonstrate feasibility in performing a limited number of high priority ADL’s. In Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate the performance of this subset of ADL’s on 3 SCI patients. Success criteria will be Pass/Fail as evaluated by clinicians. In addition, an initial patient safety assessment will be completed. Safety factors including discomfort or pain before and after the fitting of the device and no uncontrolled arm movements will be evaluated. Together, these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of APEX device to guide arm movements required to complete ADL’s and therapeutic arm movements in an ambulatory setting. ! Project Narrative Those with cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) have reduced ability to voluntarily move and use their arms and hands which results in the inability to accomplish many activities of daily living. OlympEX Medical proposes to develop and test an active powered upper extremity exoskeleton to help people with SCI and other neuromuscular conditions with their upper-limb function and rehabilitation. This will improve health, rehabilitative technology, quality of life, and independence for those with SCI.",Active Power Exoskeleton Device for Spinal Cord Injury,9465618,R43HD094440,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Bladder', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Eating', 'Elbow', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Safety', 'Sex Functioning', 'Shoulder', 'Source', 'Spastic', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Therapeutic', 'Upper Extremity', 'Voice', 'Weight Gain', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'light weight', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'operation', 'orthotics', 'patient safety', 'phase 2 study', 'phrases', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'spasticity', 'success', 'volunteer']",NICHD,"ABILITECH MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2017,239802,0.00201600912708495
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9371547,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,167135,-0.029930732284324
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9303234,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2017,249000,-0.03140635768448845
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9297123,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'physical model', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2017,186090,-0.004374956022238411
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments. This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel automated method for fitting hearing aids based on real-time speech perception performance. This automated approach can improve hearing aid success while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II,9347562,R44DC016249,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Automation', 'Businesses', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'graph theory', 'health care service', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inclusion criteria', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R44,2017,758924,-0.07976820665252932
"Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will result in a set of validated survey questions for distinguishing Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It will also produce validated survey-based and EHR-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. T1DM and T2DM are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that CDC relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. It is important for surveillance systems to be able to distinguish diabetes type to support type-specific analyses of morbidity, mortality, medical care costs, and health-related quality of life. Improved surveillance data by diabetes type can help guide and monitor federal, state, and local diabetes programs, enrich diabetes research, and support people with diabetes.",Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes,9438672,U01DP006327,[' '],NCCDPHP,"WESTAT, INC.",U01,2017,498977,-0.016562506175162462
"Environmental Imaging and Control for Exoskeletons to Improve Safety and Mobility Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system to improve the mobility and control of exoskeletons. Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and the number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year. While wheelchairs provide freedom, allowing users to be independent as well as reducing dependence upon others, wheelchair use is not physically or emotionally equivalent to walking and is often thought to limit community participation and thus exacerbate social isolation. Robotic exoskeletons/bionic suits have the potential to enable these individuals to stand up and walk, thus providing a way to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society. Our proposal seeks to address one of the hurdles limiting the widespread adoption of exoskeletons in the home and community—the inability of the user to dynamically control gait parameters. This concept has the potential to significantly change the way exoskeletons work and facilitate their adoption into the market. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the proposed solution will provide users a practical way to adjust their suit’s gait to precisely achieve their navigational goals. Specific Aims: Phase I: 1) Build a prototype and Perform Preliminary Laboratory Testing; 2) Develop and Benchmark Algorithms; and 3) Perform Pilot Human Study of Prototype with Exoskeleton Subjects. Phase II: 1) Develop Customized, Production-Ready Hardware and Firmware 2) Integrate with Exoskeleton Control System; and 3) Perform an evaluation of the system through human study testing.

"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings.

"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,9466569,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'body language', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2017,349861,-0.048404643763481824
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract The value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, their primary purpose is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, they have several fundamental limitations. Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). This Phase I project will focus on creating and evaluating a proof of concept system. An engaging, interactive training course using the prototype system will be developed as a case study for clinical nursing training on pressure injuries – an oftentimes preventable injury that is attributed to tremendous human suffering and represents a significant cost burden on our health care system. The course will leverage existing mannequin-based training used at the UMN and be evaluated by both instructors and students at the School of Nursing. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9285614,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2017,747607,-0.009323741822656991
"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation No abstract available NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9468229,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2017,29717,-0.01604991206062442
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9030093,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,542228,-0.013080713620167635
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

"A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mission of Bioniks is to develop and commercialize accurate, low-cost movement analysis systems for clinicians, ergonomists, athletic trainers, and other professionals interested in quantifying human movement. Our initial focus is on developing computer enhancements for inexpensive 3D cameras like the Microsoft Kinect. These enhancements surpass the accuracy limitations of state-of-the-art ""skeleton"" by combining established marker-based measurement protocols and advanced computer vision techniques, to generate clinical-quality 3D human motion data.  Difficult to obtain outside a laboratory setting, these kinematic data are inherently valuable for several NIH priority areas: 1) assessment of function and fatigability in older adults (NIA); 2) measurement of gait and posture biomechanics to monitor patients (NIAMS); 3) tools to enable mobile health and telemedicine by providing a means to monitor, evaluate, manage, track, train, and treat patients in underserved community settings and rural and remote locations (NIMHD, NINR); 4) tools for health informatics for clinical and translational research (NCATS); and 5) measurement of occupational health stressors in the workplace (NIOSH).  For this Phase I STTR, Bioniks' goal is to provide therapists with an affordable and easy-to-use 3D movement analysis system that quantifies an athlete's risk for, or recovery from, lower extremity injury. Our first aim is to show that the movement analysis system will not only be accurate and reliable (Aim 1), but also be practical and easy to use (Aim 2). We hypothesize that: 1) our kinematic measurements will agree with those from a gold-standard laboratory-based motion capture system (Vicon); and 2) that therapists will judge our system to be more useful and usable than current clinical tools, including traditional 2D video analyses. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a validation study with healthy volunteers at the UCSF Human Performance Center as well as a pilot usability study with therapists and healthy volunteers and patients with history of ACL injury at the SF Sports and Spine Physical Therapy Clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because of the high cost and perceived ineffectiveness of traditional musculoskeletal care, there is growing pressure on health care professionals to provide more cost- effective treatments as well as to validate treatment effectiveness. Bioniks has the opportunity to be the first clinic-based tool that quantitatively and objectively assesses musculoskeletal function of patients over the course of treatment and rehabilitation.

"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,-0.012016655336986122
"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry directional microphones with high signal-to-noise ratio, and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or “window” of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired “rocking” style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. We aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete  -axis pressure gradient sensor. Project Narrative Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the “cocktail party” effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified – making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,9098683,R44DC013746,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Client satisfaction', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Industry', 'Laboratories', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pain Threshold', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'empowered', 'hearing impairment', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R44,2016,490980,-0.009849328909752961
"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.        ",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9078547,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning network', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,299438,-0.053301115359823806
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.                ",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9035822,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2016,199277,0.004098207546113142
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9134137,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2016,1090691,-0.007610491898275909
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.        ",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9138555,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2016,750063,0.007166484384966821
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9202982,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2016,1500000,-0.02948545029634423
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,-0.03907382607524407
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety.

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",9148070,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2016,47190,0.0028514175796116167
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9145745,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2016,727321,-0.015295467674620042

"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8989105,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2016,230563,-0.007764856449216842
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9133378,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall injury', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,166809,-0.0032724801177917047
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9105328,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'mobile computing', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2016,456419,-0.024389494799623376
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9213710,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2016,249000,-0.03140635768448845
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.",The q-bio Summer School,9002062,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Professional Competence', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2016,168780,-0.014697107414767185

The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9131810,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2016,187000,-0.004374956022238411
"Environmental Imaging and Control for Exoskeletons to Improve Safety and Mobility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system to improve the mobility and control of exoskeletons. Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and the number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year. While wheelchairs provide freedom, allowing users to be independent as well as reducing dependence upon others, wheelchair use is not physically or emotionally equivalent to walking and is often thought to limit community participation and thus exacerbate social isolation. Robotic exoskeletons/bionic suits have the potential to enable these individuals to stand up and walk, thus providing a way to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society. Our proposal seeks to address one of the hurdles limiting the widespread adoption of exoskeletons in the home and community-the inability of the user to dynamically control gait parameters. This concept has the potential to significantly change the way exoskeletons work and facilitate their adoption into the market. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the proposed solution will provide users a practical way to adjust their suit's gait to precisely achieve their navigational goals. Specific Aims: Phase I: 1) Build a prototype and Perform Preliminary Laboratory Testing; 2) Develop and Benchmark Algorithms; and 3) Perform Pilot Human Study of Prototype with Exoskeleton Subjects. Phase II: 1) Develop Customized, Production-Ready Hardware and Firmware 2) Integrate with Exoskeleton Control System; and 3) Perform an evaluation of the system through human study testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and that number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control. LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.

"Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A ""meta-study"" (or ""meta-analysis"") collects and analyzes many studies on the same topic to understand if there is a meaningful, overall result. Meta-studies can support (or refute) interventions, spur new investigations, and lead to novel clinical guidelines. However, constructing meta-studies is a time intensive process of searching the literature, compiling the results, and performing the statistical analysis. Due to the time commitment that is required, many topics are unexplored, and many meta-studies are not kept up-to-date with the latest published results. Finally, a number of (unknown) biases, via subjective choices during the meta-study, may influence the results. Our long-term goal is to automate, as much as possible, the meta-study process. This should decrease subjective bias; increase the dissemination of evidence, especially for diseases and interventions that receive less attention; and allow for the automatic updating of meta-studies as new results are published. We propose a computer system that uses statistical machine learning to gather and group studies focused on similar interventions and outcomes; extract the necessary results from the text; and analyze the results using standard meta-analysis techniques. The final output will be presented in a spreadsheet-like Web-interface where users can explore and even change the data and meta-analyses. Our team uniquely blends technical expertise in machine learning with leadership in publishing meta-studies about Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), our disease of focus for our Phase I feasibility study. We are therefore qualified technically and able to ensure that the techniques generate valid and accurate meta-studies. Our Phase I results will define the current state-of-the-art for this novel task. Further, although we will initially focus n IBD, our Phase I results will demonstrate that our approach can generalize to other diseases, eventually applying to any intervention and any disease. The feasibility shown by our Phase I results will motivate our Phase II effort where we will focus on dramatically improving the approach, yielding broad coverage of all medical literature and generating human-quality meta-studies. We note that by the end of Phase I we should have a viable end-to-end prototype, focused on IBD, which we can begin taking to market. The final product should significantly benefit our target markets given the Phase II emphasis to improve the technology, user experience, and scope of covered diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A meta-analysis collects and analyzes the results from multiple studies that are all focused on the same topic, and it can confirm (or refute) the overall effect across the studies, lead to changes in clinical guidelines, or spur new directions for research. However, generating a meta-analysis is an extremely time-consuming process, so many diseases are not covered, and most meta-analyses are not updated to reflect the latest published studies. This work begins to automate the process of creating meta-analyses, overcoming these difficulties in order to make the results published in the medical literature more accessible.",Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials,8977531,R43LM012210,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dourine', 'Ensure', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prototype', 'software development', 'text searching', 'web interface']",NLM,INFERLINK CORPORATION,R43,2015,150000,-0.0006404092825761188
"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening. For Aim 1, the first 25 patients will be enrolled to develop and test alternative RL algorithms and fine-tune the system parameters. For Aim 2, we will examine changes in the probability distribution over message-types and compare that distribution with patients' reasons for non-adherence reported at baseline. For Aim 3, we will examine changes in self-reported medication non-adherence and blood pressure and automatically-reported pill bottle openings. This pilot study will establish the feasibility and potential impact of this novel approach to mobile health messaging for self-management support. The results will be used to support an R01 application for a larger and more definitive trial of intervention impacts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a major cause of death and illness and many patients fail to take their blood pressure medications as prescribed. We propose to use an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system to send different types of text messages to patients. These messages will change over time to meet patients' adherence needs and improve medication taking and blood pressure.",Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages,8829789,R21HS022336,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,159322,-0.0158565804146004
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8892263,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,413392,-0.012016655336986122

Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8997225,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,94089,-0.012016655336986122
"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8891470,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor impairment', 'named group', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2015,223669,-0.007898732303866325
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed. The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.",Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit,8840546,R01CA164993,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Cancer Control', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Housekeeping', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marshal', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'computerized data processing', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'novel', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,536065,0.006455827766366796
"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry directional microphones with high signal-to-noise ratio, and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or “window” of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired “rocking” style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. We aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete  -axis pressure gradient sensor. Project Narrative Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the “cocktail party” effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified – making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,8981015,R44DC013746,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Client satisfaction', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Industry', 'Laboratories', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pain Threshold', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'empowered', 'hearing impairment', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R44,2015,508997,-0.009849328909752961
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,8932000,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'somatosensory', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2015,1085849,-0.007610491898275909
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy.

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",8980210,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2015,56042,0.0028514175796116167
"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

"Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery. These are high priority objectives of the partner institutions in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia and align with the objective of CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria of the Center for Global Health to refine malaria interventions and develop new tools to stay ahead of the curve and ensure its global investments continue to be successful.",Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,9034805,U01GH001646,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2015,265000,-0.018052595920824095
"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8832591,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'image guided', 'imaging software', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2015,32250,-0.014566153167109073
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition,8792219,R01EY022039,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,379750,-0.02520636622714112
"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.                ",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8812658,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2015,191510,-0.007764856449216842

"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,164698,-0.0032724801177917047
"Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bruin Biometrics' proposes to develop the Joint Health Monitor (JHM), an innovative low risk device capable of detecting artificial joint implant failure prior to all currently available diagnostic devices. Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). If successful, the new monitoring device object of this proposal named ""Joint Health Monitor"" will have an immediate impact on managing joint degradation, reducing complicated revision surgeries and allowing more effective patient surveillance avoiding catastrophic failure; this in turn will increase patient confidence in regulatory agencies and industry.            ",Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics,8906609,R43AR067048,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arithmetic', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Bone Tissue', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumer Advocacy', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Dislocations', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hip region structure', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteolysis', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Radiation', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trust', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'follow-up', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'human subject', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'rapid detection', 'sample fixation', 'tool']",NIAMS,"BRUIN BIOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2015,149685,-0.018868837888343083
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems.

"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.            ",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,8949658,K24NR015812,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'patient oriented research', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2015,188616,-0.004374956022238411
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8775624,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2015,90000,-0.03140635768448845
"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users.

"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics.

"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8787459,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,16530,-0.029476135435229082
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8935645,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,652270,-0.009323741822656991

"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening. For Aim 1, the first 25 patients will be enrolled to develop and test alternative RL algorithms and fine-tune the system parameters. For Aim 2, we will examine changes in the probability distribution over message-types and compare that distribution with patients' reasons for non-adherence reported at baseline. For Aim 3, we will examine changes in self-reported medication non-adherence and blood pressure and automatically-reported pill bottle openings. This pilot study will establish the feasibility and potential impact of this novel approach to mobile health messaging for self-management support. The results will be used to support an R01 application for a larger and more definitive trial of intervention impacts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a major cause of death and illness and many patients fail to take their blood pressure medications as prescribed. We propose to use an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system to send different types of text messages to patients.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.                ",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8749880,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'named group', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2014,204427,-0.007898732303866325
"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements.

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity  Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or ""window"" of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired ""rocking"" style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. In Phase II, we aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete 3-axis pressure gradient sensor. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the ""cocktail party"" effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified - making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.            ",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,8648777,R43DC013746,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Client satisfaction', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Microfabrication', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pain Threshold', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'empowered', 'hearing impairment', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R43,2014,149828,-0.007546902972657246

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.                  ",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,8696689,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,1152001,-0.007610491898275909
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.                ",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8690845,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,819964,-0.009852738428696139
"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures.

"Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inability to access information on printed signs directly impacts the mobility independence of the over 1.2 million blind persons in the U.S. Many previously proposed technological solutions to this problem either required physical modifications to the environment (talking signs or the placement of coded markers) or required the user to carry around specialized computational equipment, which can be stigmatizing. A recently pursued strategy is to utilize the computational capabilities of smart phones and techniques from computer vision to allow blind persons to read signs at a distance using commercially available, non-stigmatizing, smart- phones. However, despite the fact that sophisticated algorithms exist to recognize and extract sign text from cluttered video input (as evidenced, for example, by mapping services such as Google Maps automatically locating and blurring out only license plate text in street-view maps) current mobile solutions for reading sign text at a distance perform relatively poorly. This poor performance is largely because until recently, smart-phone processors have simply not been able to execute state-of-the-art computer vision text extraction and recognition algorithms at real-time rates, which forced previous mobile sign readers to utilize older, simplistic, less effective algorithms. Next-generation smart-phones run on fundamentally different, hybrid processor architectures (such as the Tegra 4, Snapdragon 800, both released in 2013) with dedicated embedded graphical processing units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs, which make them ideal for high-performance, vision-heavy computation. In this study, we propose to develop a smart-phone-based system for finding and reading signs at a distance which significantly outperforms previous such readers by implementing state-of-the-art text extraction algorithms on modern smart-phone hybrid GPU/CPU processor architectures. In Phase I, the proposed system will be developed and tested with blind users. In Phase II, feedback from user testing will be integrated into system design and the performance will be improved to permit operation in extremely challenging (such as low light) environments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 1.2 million people in the US are blind, and lack of safe and independent mobility substantially impacts the quality of life of this population. Printed textual signs, which are ubiquitously used in sighted navigation, are inaccessible to visually impaired persons, and this lack of access to environmental information contributes significantly to the mobility problem. This research would help develop a system whereby blind persons could use commercially available smart-phones to locate and read sign text at a distance.            ",Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices,8779810,R43EY024800,"['Acceleration', 'Access to Information', 'Algorithms', 'Antirrhinum', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Hybrids', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modification', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Running', 'SKI gene', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'assistive device/technology', 'authority', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'next generation', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'volunteer']",NEI,"LYNNTECH, INC.",R43,2014,229742,-0.03405609592244225
"Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Ai Cure Technologies LLC was established in 2009 to develop automated medication adherence monitoring solutions using computer vision technology. This SBIR Phase II will allow Ai Cure Technologies to test the accuracy and validity of its flagship product, AiView"". The SBIR Phase I demonstrated that the AiView"" platform was technically feasible and capable of confirming medication administration. Significance: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice. The inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounds the problem. Clinical trials depend on people taking the drug being tested. The problem of medication adherence has been addressed - determinants of adherence are being studied and new monitoring methods developed - but no solution has been able to accurately confirm real-time medication adherence while also being affordable, flexible, and likable. The Product: Ai Cure Technologies will provide an automated DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam- enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. AiView"" will visually track and confirm medication administration without human supervision. Long-Term Goal: The AiView"" system will combine sophisticated computer vision technology with the best attributes of DOT for 1/400th of the cost. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow them to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance. Phase II hypothesis: AiView"" can be used to accurately measure and improve medication adherence across different patient populations, and positively impact self-perception and clinical outcomes. Specific Aim #1: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can accurately measure and improve medication adherence in a depression and a stroke patient population. Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can improve self-perception and improve clinical outcomes in the AiView"" intervention groups Expected Outcome: The patients in the AiView"" intervention groups (depression and stroke) are expected to have statistically significant higher adherence rates than those in the pill counting groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice with the inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounding the problem. In accordance with this SBIR Phase II grant, Ai Cure Technologies will continue development and testing of its Automated DOTSM (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam-enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow tria administrators to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance, thus improving the accuracy of clinical trials the overall safety of the drug development process.            ",Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology,8670794,R44TR000873,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phase IV Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'non-compliance', 'patient population', 'pill', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,"AI CURE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2014,888295,0.001174907401024296
"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.

PERFORMANCE PERIOD 09/16/ This proposal describes enhancements to Viocare’s Mobile Food Intake Visual and Voice Recognizer (FIVR)  System, a novel combination of innovative technologies including computer vision and speech recognition to  measure dietary intake using a mobile phone. FIVR uses a mobile phone’s camera to capture a short video  of foods to be consumed, which is then verbally-annotated on the mobile phone by the user. These video  and audio files are processed through a real-time backend server speech and image recognition engine for  food recognition and portion size measurement. This project will extend FIVR’s capabilities to analyze more  foods, enhance the analysis and reporting tools, expand system support tools, and develop interfaces to a  diverse set of clinical and research systems. A final evaluation of the FIVR system will be conducted at The  Ohio State University to assess the usability and accuracy of food intake tracking with a group of 100 freeliving  subjects, comparing 4 days of FIVR food intake data to 4 days of 24 hour recalls collected using  ASA24 data. The resulting FIVR product will be a unique food intake tracker that combines selfadministration,  automation (vision), and backend coding to collect food intake records to generate a detailed  nutritional analysis. n/a","HHSN261201400054C; TOPIC 308 AUTOMATED COLLECTION, STORAGE, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING SYSTEMS FOR DIETARY IMAGES 'TITLE: THE MOBILE FOOD INTAKE PHOTO STORAGE & ANALYSIS SYSTEM.

"Motion, Artifact Cancelling MIMO Method for Ambulatory Respiratory Rate Monitorin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing are directly associated with deteriorating conditions in patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chroni obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in these patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. Unfortunately, continuous monitoring of respiratory rate and pattern is often overlooked or neglected in clinical practice due to the general difficulty in performing these measurements, especially in non-intubated ambulatory settings. Present measurement methods that capture the patient's airway are most accurate but difficult to administer and often intolerable for the patient, whereas methods that rely on capturing chest motion historically suffer from poor accuracy due to motion artifacts.  We propose a MIMO-based motion artifact cancelling multi-lead impedance measurement method for robust ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. We have recently demonstrated that respiration and motion artifacts are theoretically separable in ambulatory subjects with multi-lead impedance measurements. The motion artifacts are sporadic and localized high energy non-stationary events compared to respiratory signals. Due to the limited dynamic range and quantization errors of the conventional data acquisition system, source separation algorithms struggle to extract reliable respiratory signal information. The proposed MIMO system approach overcomes these limitations by integrating statistical learning directly within analog to digital conversion process. As a result, this miniaturized hardware realization method enables continuous, real-time and power-efficient tracking of the respiratory signal corrupted by motion artifacts.  Preliminary study of the MIMO based algorithm has shown promising results for ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. In this research we plan to develop the optimized hardware prototype of the MIMO system to validate the performance under real ambulatory conditions. We believe that the MIMO based multi-lead imped- ance measurement method is likely to be accepted by both clinicians and patients due to routine use of electrodes. Going forward, in our future work we envision integrating the proposed research with ECG monitoring sharing same set of electrodes to provide continuous and accurate cardiorespiratory information for general ward as well as for home health/wellness monitoring of ambulatory patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in COPD and HF patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. In ambulatory patients, accuracy remains an issue for non-intubated methods relying on chest motion due to physical motion artifacts. We propose to develop and validate MIMO based motion-artifact cancelling multi-lead impedance measurement technique for robust ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring.            ","Motion, Artifact Cancelling MIMO Method for Ambulatory Respiratory Rate Monitorin",8702170,R21EB015608,"['Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Breathing', 'Caregivers', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Ward', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impedance Plethysmography', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'instrument', 'miniaturize', 'neglect', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'sedentary', 'signal processing']",NIBIB,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R21,2014,230240,-0.03161729943677571
"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.            ","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8718641,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2014,34424,-0.014566153167109073
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180608,-0.0032724801177917047
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track  ABSTRACT The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic affect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs to unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the elderly can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.            ",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,8647170,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2014,222981,-0.02516231624632527
"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.            ",The q-bio Summer School,8643269,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2014,171217,-0.014697107414767185
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through  multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8618418,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2014,90000,-0.03140635768448845
"Development of a Centralized Intelligence and Control AP Hub Device ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite major advances in pharmaceuticals and medical device technology, the ability to safely and effectively control blood glucose in patients with Type 1 diabetes has remained a recalcitrant challenge and a significant source of human suffering and economic cost. With the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), increasing effort has been focused on the development of artificial pancreas (AP) systems using CGM coupled with insulin pump via closed-loop control (CLC) algorithms. Integration of these disparate technologies and implementation in a commercial product has faced numerous challenges to date. TypeZero Technologies' objective is the commercialization of the robust and extensively tested Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) software platform and supporting technology into a commercial-grade device ""hub"" designed to organize and control a network of medical devices for the improved management of blood glucose in the context of Type 1 diabetes. The DiAs prototype has been extensively tested to date, and has generated over 24,000 hours of on- patient data. In numerous clinical trials, this technology has reduced dramatically the frequency of occurrence of severe hyper- and hypoglycemic events, reduced glycemic variability and improved patient's ""time-in-range"" (rate of euglycemia). DiAs and supporting technologies represent the core elements of a radically different treatment paradigm that integrates and maximizes the capabilities of existing and currently approved medical devices with a proprietary software platform and control technologies. The key characteristics of the TypeZero hub are:  "" Modular hub functionality residing optionally within and across available networked devices including the  patient's pump, meter, CGM, smartphone, or within cloud services;  "" Ability to accommodate any control strategy that is deemed optimal for a specific patient;  "" Inherently layered architecture, designed with an upward pathway of sequential module deployment;  "" Inherent safety, featuring a downward pathway of graceful degradation to a known system state in the  event of component failure; and  "" Local and Global modes of operation enabling the availability of certain processes and patient  interaction through the portable device; other services and remote monitoring of subject and system  state are available via telecommunication (e.g. 3G, WiFi, etc.). We envision that in the near future consumer electronics hardware equipped with appropriate software (e.g. DiAs) would gradually replace specialized CGM receivers or insulin pump controllers, merging into a single ultra-portable platform the functions of continuous monitoring, insulin delivery, and closed-loop control. In the near-term, we envision creating a dedicated hub controller that will host key functionalities of artificial pancreas as a critical step toward the future.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The persistent challenge of safely and effectively managing blood glucose levels in the context of Type 1 diabetes indicates the inadequacy of currently approved and available medical device technologies. Artificial pancreas approaches to algorithm-based control of medical devices for improved patient safety and outcomes has been an active area of research for many years. TypeZero Technologies seeks to commercialize a proprietary suite of technologies that have been developed and extensively tested in clinical trial settings and shown to deliver significant improvements in safety and efficacy. The successful development of TypeZero's hub device will represent a novel integration of capabilities that will dramatically accelerate the commercial availability of artificial pancreas technologies.        ",Development of a Centralized Intelligence and Control AP Hub Device,8823176,R43DK104293,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Continuous Infusion', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Judgment', 'Kidney Failure', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transition Elements', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'design', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'meter', 'middleware', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'safety testing', 'subcutaneous']",NIDDK,"TYPEZERO TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2014,224354,0.00880360245544706
"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a  web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users.

"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp  This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for hearing aids, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based upon individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one's ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely results in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change the hearing aid sales and delivery models yet can also be implemented within existing business models by replacing contemporary hearing aid fitting methods (e.g. adjusting to gain-frequency targets followed by subjective fine tuning) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. Successful implementation of the ISPS technology will impact several barriers identified in RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting hearing aids and minimizing the need for highly skilled expertise), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs) and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to hearing aid fitting for patients who tend to avoid seeking professional help). This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility for the ISPS approach by (1) implementing the ISPS on a standard personal computer, (2) integrating the ISPS with a commercially available hearing aid, and (3) completing a pilot clinical study comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase II project will be proposed to enable extension of the technology to a wide range of hearing aids, patient characteristics and listening environments, including innovations supporting the use for remote and self-fitting applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel approach for fitting hearing aids using an individual's speech perception abilities. This automated approach can improved listener performance while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.                ",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp,8626066,R43DC013623,"['Achievement', 'Acoustics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R43,2014,149994,-0.09950763034373217
"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH.

Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.            ",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8620889,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198360,-0.029455855733002814
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8815713,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,709980,-0.009323741822656991
"Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 3 million emergency intubations are performed in the US every year and failure rates can be as high as 50% (3-5). Success is highly dependent on how frequently the responder performs this life-saving procedure on humans (6). Brio Device, LLC, an airway management medical device company, is addressing the need to decouple the success of the procedure from the experience of the user with their ""smart"" intubation device which integrates anatomic structure recognition algorithms and visual guidance feedback with an articulating stylet. Brio's intubation device is specifically designed fo the needs of emergency responders, such as paramedics, emergency department personnel, code teams in hospitals and military medics, who often arrive at the patient first. The smart intubation device will reduce failure rates by providing the user with visual instruction of the correct path to the trachea as he places the endotracheal tube. The guidance software uses machine learning and computer vision algorithms to recognize the anatomy and determine the path to insert the tube. Ultimately, the intubation device will include both a guidance display on an LCD screen and an optical stylet that has single-axis angulation control of the distal tip. For the purpose of this Phase I study, a laptop or desktop computer will be used for the image processing and the guidance display that accompanies the articulating stylet. The long-term goal is to create a device that is compact, light-weight and portable to suit the needs of ambulances and hospital crash carts.  The hypothesis for this study is that by incorporating a video guidance display with an articulating stylet, inexperienced users will be more successful in correctly placing the endotracheal tube using this device compared to direct laryngoscopy. To achieve this goal, image processing and machine learning algorithms will be developed to recognize key anatomic structures in the airway. Software will also be developed determine the path the tube should follow and to display this information for the user. Finally, the efficacy of the device will be validated in airway simulation mannequins with medical students serving as the inexperienced users. Phase II will focus on integrating the guidance software, articulating optical stylet and display into a portable device with embedded hardware and software contained within the stylet handle. At completion of Phase II, the device will be ready for clinica trials and FDA testing.  Brio will enter the $20 billion airway market with its intubation device. Initial sales will begin with anesthesiologists who are early adopters of new technology to assist with difficult airways. Brio will market its product to ~327,000 clinicians who use intubation devices. The U.S. addressable market for emergency intubation is ~$900M for the 41,000 ambulances and 5,800 emergency departments and hospital code teams.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this SBIR Phase I, Brio Device, LLC plans to create and evaluate a device that improves the success rate of emergency intubations by coupling a smart guidance display with a user-controlled single-axis articulating stylet. Emergency intubations are often performed in challenging situations by personnel who do the procedure infrequently. Since failure rates are as high as 50% and approximately 180,000 deaths occur each year from failed pre-hospital intubations, a device is needed to provide visual guidance information to assist the users and increase their success rates in emergency situations.            ",Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation,8453607,R43HL114160,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulances', 'Anatomic structures', 'Anatomy', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Critical Care', 'Destinations', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Emergency Situation', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Left', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Marketing', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Students', 'Military Hospitals', 'Military Personnel', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxygen', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Resuscitation', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Tube', 'Visual', 'commercial application', 'design', 'endotracheal', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information display', 'laptop', 'light weight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'success']",NHLBI,"BRIO DEVICE, LLC",R43,2013,244710,-0.014753435807014841

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.        Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,-0.012016655336986122
"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.            ",A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition,8521782,R43NS083098,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bradykinesia', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Dystonia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Essential Tremor', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Video Recording', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Writing', 'advanced system', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel therapeutics', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2013,424766,0.0052652536969818465
"Restoring arm and hand motor function with non-invasive spinal stimulation.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of car can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the cervical cord to improve arm and hand function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical single-channel (stimulation of one part of the spinal cord) and dual-channel (stimulation of two different parts of the cord) paradigm that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the cervical spinal cord can improve motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a dual-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof- of-principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervical spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the cervical cord that improves use of the arms and hands.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Electrical modulation of the spinal cord can restore voluntary motor function in patients with spinal cord injury, a phenomenon we have demonstrated with both implantable electric devices and devices that provide electrical stimulation to the cord through the surface of the skin. Here, we propose to build and test a refined device that stimulates the skin above the spinal cord at two different locations to improve arm and hand motor function in spinal cord injury patients.                ",Restoring arm and hand motor function with non-invasive spinal stimulation.,8591945,R43EB017641,"['Address', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Back', 'Bypass', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Felis catus', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lumbar spinal cord structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Muscle', 'Music', 'Neck', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outpatients', 'Painless', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat-1', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Part', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'comparative efficacy', 'design', 'grasp', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'injured', 'life time cost', 'motor function improvement', 'neuroregulation', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,"NEUROENABLING TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2013,206411,0.004551047308198873
"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.

This project lays the foundation for a new treatment paradigm for human partial epilepsy: delivering antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy only during periods of increased probability of seizure onset. Rather than treating patients with chronic daily AEDs, we will validate neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy, were patients receive AEDs only when they are needed to prevent seizures.

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI  A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age.

To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.

We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise.

"Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Ai Cure Technologies LLC was established in 2009 to develop automated medication adherence monitoring solutions using computer vision technology. This SBIR Phase II will allow Ai Cure Technologies to test the accuracy and validity of its flagship product, AiView"". The SBIR Phase I demonstrated that the AiView"" platform was technically feasible and capable of confirming medication administration. Significance: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice. The inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounds the problem. Clinical trials depend on people taking the drug being tested. The problem of medication adherence has been addressed - determinants of adherence are being studied and new monitoring methods developed - but no solution has been able to accurately confirm real-time medication adherence while also being affordable, flexible, and likable. The Product: Ai Cure Technologies will provide an automated DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam- enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. AiView"" will visually track and confirm medication administration without human supervision. Long-Term Goal: The AiView"" system will combine sophisticated computer vision technology with the best attributes of DOT for 1/400th of the cost. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow them to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance. Phase II hypothesis: AiView"" can be used to accurately measure and improve medication adherence across different patient populations, and positively impact self-perception and clinical outcomes. Specific Aim #1: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can accurately measure and improve medication adherence in a depression and a stroke patient population. Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can improve self-perception and improve clinical outcomes in the AiView"" intervention groups Expected Outcome: The patients in the AiView"" intervention groups (depression and stroke) are expected to have statistically significant higher adherence rates than those in the pill counting groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice with the inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounding the problem. In accordance with this SBIR Phase II grant, Ai Cure Technologies will continue development and testing of its Automated DOTSM (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam-enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow tria administrators to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance, thus improving the accuracy of clinical trials the overall safety of the drug development process.            ",Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology,8524716,R44TR000873,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phase IV Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'non-compliance', 'patient population', 'pill', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,"AI CURE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2013,895818,0.001174907401024296
"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.            ",Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application,8492838,R21DK098556,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Proliferating', 'Psychologist', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'information processing', 'lifestyle intervention', 'medical schools', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web interface', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2013,263542,-0.017240371821431365
"Motion, Artifact Cancelling MIMO Method for Ambulatory Respiratory Rate Monitorin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing are directly associated with deteriorating conditions in patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chroni obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in these patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. Unfortunately, continuous monitoring of respiratory rate and pattern is often overlooked or neglected in clinical practice due to the general difficulty in performing these measurements, especially in non-intubated ambulatory settings. Present measurement methods that capture the patient's airway are most accurate but difficult to administer and often intolerable for the patient, whereas methods that rely on capturing chest motion historically suffer from poor accuracy due to motion artifacts.  We propose a MIMO-based motion artifact cancelling multi-lead impedance measurement method for robust ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. We have recently demonstrated that respiration and motion artifacts are theoretically separable in ambulatory subjects with multi-lead impedance measurements. The motion artifacts are sporadic and localized high energy non-stationary events compared to respiratory signals. Due to the limited dynamic range and quantization errors of the conventional data acquisition system, source separation algorithms struggle to extract reliable respiratory signal information. The proposed MIMO system approach overcomes these limitations by integrating statistical learning directly within analog to digital conversion process. As a result, this miniaturized hardware realization method enables continuous, real-time and power-efficient tracking of the respiratory signal corrupted by motion artifacts.  Preliminary study of the MIMO based algorithm has shown promising results for ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. In this research we plan to develop the optimized hardware prototype of the MIMO system to validate the performance under real ambulatory conditions. We believe that the MIMO based multi-lead imped- ance measurement method is likely to be accepted by both clinicians and patients due to routine use of electrodes. Going forward, in our future work we envision integrating the proposed research with ECG monitoring sharing same set of electrodes to provide continuous and accurate cardiorespiratory information for general ward as well as for home health/wellness monitoring of ambulatory patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in COPD and HF patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. In ambulatory patients, accuracy remains an issue for non-intubated methods relying on chest motion due to physical motion artifacts. We propose to develop and validate MIMO based motion-artifact cancelling multi-lead impedance measurement technique for robust ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring.            ","Motion, Artifact Cancelling MIMO Method for Ambulatory Respiratory Rate Monitorin",8582895,R21EB015608,"['Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Breathing', 'Caregivers', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Ward', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impedance Plethysmography', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'instrument', 'miniaturize', 'neglect', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'sedentary']",NIBIB,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R21,2013,302200,-0.03161729943677571
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.            ",The q-bio Summer School,8475276,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2013,174626,-0.014697107414767185
"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users. The results of the project will enable such individuals to explore new opportunities and be more productive, thus providing improved employment potential and an increase in the quality of life.                ",Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with,8459121,R44EY020082,"['Advertisements', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Boxing', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grouping', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interest Group', 'Internet', 'Literature', 'Marketing', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'base', 'blind', 'commercialization', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'natural language', 'phrases', 'preference', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'web page', 'web site']",NEI,"VORTANT TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2013,371933,-0.00801262640584434
"Advanced training platform and methodologies for emergency responders and skilled     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need to be able to deliver just-in-time training and reference materials for first responders and skilled support personnel. Mobile computing platforms are becoming ubiquitous and provide an ideal means to reach users at any time in any location. The process of translating existing reference materials into mobile-friendly formats is currently manual and very labor intensive. Nicolalde R&D LLC is well under way to commercialize its mTraining mobile technology and service prototyped during a phase I SBIR from NIEHS. The mTraining technology is an objective and checklist-based method for delivering just-in-time training and reference materials, making it an effective Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) for providing workers easy access to information after training, and on site prior to or during an assignment. It provides short, incident specific awareness and safety training that can be delivered prior to responding to an emergency situation. The proposed development under this phase II SBIR includes: a) a back-end document processing engine that is able to automatically parse, analyze, mark-up, and organize documents so that their content is easily cross-referenced, linked and re-organized for effective delivery on a mobile training platform or other electronic medium. This will be connected to a server and database architecture to facilitate its operation and support storing and accessing content; b) the front-end interface for the mobile training platform (mTraining) was prototyped in Phase I of this project for delivering training content to emergency responders, skilled support personnel, and volunteers before or during an incident. The improved back-end architecture will support intelligent search capabilities for a large repository of training documents with different structures. This capability relies on the document processing engine's ability to semi-automatically extract relevant data and automatically translate this data into a structured format. This data can then be used for display in the mobile application, stored into databases, and automatically populated into ontologies. Throughout this project the participatory-based design paradigm has been used for facilitating the integration of user requirements and the fast prototyping and testing of design alternatives. This approach will continue to be utilized in Phase 2 of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and development will advance the field of environmental health and safety training by bringing to it new and innovative advanced training technologies that are based on the mobile and just-in-time paradigm.

"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8521678,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2013,343684,-0.02107327060947427

"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.          Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.

"Developing an online educational curriculum to enhance parent-supervised driving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs. The CDC has identified traffic crashes and associated injuries as a top public health priority. Inexperience is the leading cause of crashes among novice teen drivers, but accumulating the necessary experiences to become a safe driver can take many years. Fortunately, evidence from driving and other domains suggests that it is possible to increase experiential knowledge through scenario-based training. Current methods for providing teens with practice focus on parent-supervised driving. However, parents are ill-prepared to handle this role, with many focusing only on the mechanics of driving, laws and general safety advice. Few parents discuss decision-making aspects of driving and may even pass on inaccurate information. Many parents limit the range of driving situations teens are exposed to mistakenly believing that this increases safety rather than dangerously limiting teens' ability to accumulate important driving experience. Our long-term objective is to design and validate an innovative tool that aims to accelerate the acquisition of critical safety knowledge for teen drivers. We propose to extend our team's past work by developing scenarios appropriate for parents to use to mentor their inexperienced teen drivers. The scenarios will be part of an online educational curriculum designed to help parents provide teens with guided practice as they learn how to drive. The online tool will combine scenario- based training with innovative applications of machine learning technology to evaluate scenario responses and provide tailored feedback containing practical, developmentally appropriate strategies for improving safety as well as recommendations for parent-supervised on-the-road practice. Phase I will address these specific aims: 1) Conduct foundational research to identify realistic scenarios commonly encountered by novice teen drivers through semi-structured interviews with teen drivers aged 15-18. 2) Collect representative responses to scenarios from teens with different levels of driving experience and adults to identify the progression of knowledge and identify developmentally appropriate strategies to use as feedback. 3) Create machine learning algorithms to provide tailored feedback and recommend on-the-road driving experiences based on responses to the scenarios. 4) Develop prototype online system. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 5) Develop the Phase I proof of concept into a complete online curriculum with refined algorithms. 6) Evaluate the online curriculum for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a driving simulator experiment and limited field trial with novice teen drivers. The proposed product represents a significant shift in trainig approaches for teen drivers and through Phase III dissemination it will fill a critical need for evidence- based parent-taught driver's education.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs; despite this, many teens' primary source of driver's education is their parents. In Phase I we propose to extend our past work for teaching experiential knowledge and develop a prototype online educational curriculum that allows parents to provide teens with guided practice by utilizing innovative machine learning technologies, while Phase II will allow us to complete the prototype and evaluate its effectiveness.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.           Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions.

"SmartTool for Anomaly Detection in Radiotherapy Treatment Plan Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adverse events and medical errors result in thousands of accidental deaths and over one million excess injuries each year. To avoid medical errors in radiation cancer treatment, careful attention needs to be made to ensure accurate implementation of the intended treatment plan. We propose a SmartTool to automatically detect and highlight potential errors in a radiotherapy treatment plan, in real time and before its execution. SmartTool will double check all the treatment parameters in the background against a previously built Predictive Model of a Medical Error (PMME) and flag the operator, [post human QA,] if there is a discrepancy in the treatment plan, by stopping execution, highlighting the outlier treatment parameter and prompting human intervention. To build the PMME we will mine the dataset of previously treated cancer patients, by clustering the data in the groups based on treatment parameter similarity, labeling the clusters and using an innovative algorithm to build a highly accurate anomaly detection tool. PMME will also be dynamically updated [to include new treatment data instances coming in to the system, and updating the model should any treatment flags be identified as false positive or false negative]. The vastly innovative aspect of SmartTool is in the novel use of machine learning techniques to automatically build an anomaly prediction model on unlabeled data (customarily a labeled data is required to build a predictive model) and provide an automatic, real time and unobtrusive intelligent computational treatment checking algorithm. Moreover, having an analytical model of an outlier/anomaly offers the capability to describe the conditions of the outlier being created and is the essential in gaining investigative (and medical) insight in what went wrong and how to improve the process in the future.

"Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications     DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)    Abstract: Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications? Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortaiity, both in the United Statesl and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. Classic behavior change theories provide a foundation to develop and understand effective health campaigns and interventions;3 however there is still considerable variability in the effectiveness of such campaigns that we are unable to predict and explain. By improving our ability to understand and predict behavior change, neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) may aid in the creation of maximally effective health campaigns. There may be important precursors of behavior change that are not easily obtained through self-reports, but that can be assessed with fMRl. In particular, people are notoriously limited in their ability to predict their own future  o. behavior and accurately identiy their internal mental processes through verbal and written self-report Our team has found that activity in a prioridefined neural regions of interest can double the proportion of variance explained in individual behavior change following persuasive messaging, beyond self-report measures (e.9. attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy).5'6 The current proposal posits a next leap: neuroimaging technology may also be applied to more accurately forecast population level responses to health communications, and could dramatically improve the way that we design and select health communications. To this end, we propose to: (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of new health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms of message success to advance theory and to develop novel strategies for message design. We will employ sophisticated multivariate and machine learning data analysis techniques (e.9. reinforcement learning models and pattern classification) to characterize the neural systems that are involved in processing successful health messages (i.e. messages that ultimately facilitate behavior change in larger, independent groups). Such techniques will provide insight about the mechanisms that lead messages to be optimally effective for populations on average, as well as helping to understand heterogeneity within populations (i.e. for whom are given messages likely to be most effective). These techniques will also allow us to define models that optimally combine neuroimaging data with other available data sources (e.9. self-report). Achievement of our goals (to identify neural patterns that predict message success and to test the psychological meaning of these activations) will facilitate the design and dissemination of more effective health messages, and will allow more efficient translation of core theoretical advances across behavior and disease specific silos.    Public Health Relevance: Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States1 and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.                  The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures.

"Passive Activity Monitoring with Patient Identification and Gesture Detection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). Ingenium Care proposes to create a passive, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons using the novel technology of Microsoft's Kinect device. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium Care's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, people with disabilities, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. Existing monitoring technology has limited activity recognition capability or uses many sensors and wearable devices. The need for wearable devices requires cooperation from the elderly that may not reminder or resent to wear it. We propose to replace our existing wearable badge technology with a passive device based on the Kinect device from Microsoft. A network of these sensors provides precise location information within a home or facility and detects falls and gestures such as eating, drinking or taking medications. This device will eliminate the need to wear any device. Aim #1 - Goal: Develop Algorithms for Proof of Concept Gesture Recognition. Aim #2 - Goal: Do laboratory training and testing of detection algorithms utilizing a single work station. Aim #3 - Goal: Perform randomized activities and gestures in a simulated living environment and iteratively improve algorithms.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"OTHER FUNCTIONS SBIR TOPIC 308, PHASE I: THE MOBILE FOOD INTAKE PHOTO STORAGE AN This proposal describes plans to enhance Viocare¿s Mobile Food Intake Visual and Voice Recognizer (FIVR) System. FIVR, an active Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI) project, is a novel combination of innovative technologies including computer vision and speech recognition to measure dietary intake using a mobile phone. Version 1 of FIVR uses a mobile phone¿s embedded camera to capture a short video of food to be consumed. The food to be eaten is annotated verbally on the mobile phone by the user.

"Fractal Identification System for Medication     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ai Cure Technologies LLC, was established in 2009 to develop computer vision solutions to ensure safer medication usage. This SBIR Phase I will allow Ai Cure Technologies to prove feasibility of an innovative identification and anti-counterfei labeling solution that replaces traditional barcodes and utilizes the self-similarity properties of fractals to encode and print unique secure fractal patterns directly onto pills or capsules. This SBIR Phase I will allow technical feasibility of this solution, Fractal-ID"", to be demonstrated and will test if a fractal pattern can be printed onto a pill and then recognized with computer vision software. The ability to accurately identify and authenticate pills enables medication to be correctly prescribed and administered. Yet a drug's packaging and labeling is not a stamp of authenticity. It is almost impossible for patients and healthcare professionals to identify pills based on their physical characteristics and to decipher the pill's imprint, its unique identifying code. As a result, the twin problems of counterfeit medication and medication errors - both of which depend upon pill identification - are very difficult to stem. Medication errors contribute heavily to the public health burden. 1.5 million people are harmed every year in the US because of medication errors and the cost for hospitals alone is approximately $3.5 billion. The physical appearances of pills play a large part - it is estimated that a pill's packaging and labeling are responsible for one third of medication errors. More than 10% of the world's drugs are counterfeit, rising to 50% for certain drugs in developing countries. The counterfeit drug market is estimated to be between $75 and $200 billion per year and is growing in countries with strict regulations. 100,000 deaths are attributed to counterfeit drugs every year and there is an unknown morbidity toll since substandard or counterfeit medicines are also responsible for drug resistance, therapeutic failure and dangerous health outcomes. Since medications are repackaged and change hands many times in the supply chain, direct pill and capsule labeling offers a more robust solution to medication identification. While barcodes may be used to serialize individual pills, their fixed designs are unsuitable for the shape, color, texture variablity found in pills and capsules. Furthermore, barcodes are easy to replicate, require fixed surface areas and specific alignment for printing, and are rendered unusable if occlusion occurs due to handling or damage. In addition, the item's physical attributes are distinct from the barcode itself. Ai Cure Technologies will offer pharmaceutical manufacturers, Fractal-ID(tm), a medication identification and authentication solution. The solution will equip manufacturers with printers and a license to a secure fractal label library; consumers will have access to a free computer vision software application to identify fractal pills; and investigators will be provided with higher resolution authentication tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to accurately identify and authenticate pills enables medication to be correctly prescribed and administered.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.              The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array to Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load- bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with pharmacological and motor training interventions.  Within the first 2.5 years of the present BRP Grant, not within the five years as initially proposed, we have gathered sufficient data to demonstrate that the human lumbosacral spinal cord has similar capabilities.  We have shown that an individual with a motor complete spinal cord injury can regain independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation after months of testing different spinal cord stimulation patterns and motor training.  Just as important and as impressive is the recovery of significant levels of bladder control, blood pressure, and temperature regulation, and even sexual function in this patient (13a).  These intriguing results compel us to begin additional efforts to overcome what are now recognized as the most critical factors limiting our progress toward making this intervention available in the clinic.  Based on our results, it is clear that we can develop the capability to selectively activae combinations of neural networks that can enable standing and probably stepping with improved technology in humans with a functionally motor complete spinal cord injury.  These functional improvements are even more likely to benefit those individuals that are functionally motor incomplete, but have severely impaired mobility.  Our present accomplishments have been realized using technology that is three decades old and initially designed for a different purpose, i.e., pain management.  Thus we are requesting funds to overcome the present technical, not physiological, limitations as expediently and as carefully as possible.  More specifically, the rat limiting factors are the lack of technology for chronic implants for a high number of electrodes and the need for a more clear understanding of how these epidural stimulation arrays can modulate the spinal circuitries.  To overcome these factors we need to 1) develop a device that will allow us to chronically implant an integrated electrode array and multiplexed stimulation device in rats with the necessary signal control capabilities, 2) evaluate hypotheses that will guide us to more clearly understand how to modulate the stimulation parameters to activate the desired spinal circuits, 3) develop a learning strategy to automatically optimize the stimulation parameters for a given patient to stand, step, or exert voluntary control, and 4) begin to explore the pathways through which voluntary control can be regained after a severe spinal cord injury.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.  This technology includes the capability to stimulate the lower spinal cord in a manner that can enable a patient with complete paraplegia to stand and to step.  This project outlines the newly recognized technical capabilities that must be developed to accomplish this goal.                   It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway.

"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.                Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.              Project Narrative Collaboration between malaria Branch of CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine to conduct research to improve the control of malaria in high risk populations, with a special emphasis on studies of the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia and Kenya.",Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01),8131740,U01CK000146,[' '],NCEZID,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2011,160500,-0.038057057644190616
"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.        Disclaimer:  Please note that the following critiques were prepared by the reviewers prior to the Study Section meeting and are provided in an essentially unedited form.

"NLP for Augmentative and Alternative Communication in Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal relates to the technology of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).  The research, to be developed over the three-year course of this project, relates to increasing communication speed for adult users of typing-based AAC devices. The proposed method has commonalities both with chatter bots and more sophisticated automated question answering systems. In particular, we propose to develop a program that will mine a very large database of stored interactions for sentences that are similar to the sentence currently being uttered by the interlocutor, and propose a set of plausible responses for the AAC user. The outcome of this research will be a system that improves over the current state of the art in whole utterance approaches in AAC, making use of sophisticated natural language processing techniques.    Through this research and its practical application to helping real people with real communications needs, as well as coursework, seminars, participation in the AAC and disabilities community in Portland, OR, and intensive one-on-one meetings with his mentor Dr. Melanie Fried-Oken, the PI will accrue substantial clinical experience in AAC, and will gain a deep understanding of how technology can be used to help people.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop a research program in the field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Interactive, Self-programming, AI System for Activity Monitoring of the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). More than half felt they were ""on duty"" 24 hours a day, and half had to end/reduce employment due to the demands of care-giving. Ingenium proposes to create a practical, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly, disabled, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. The goal in this proposal is to produce a system that can reliably recognize activities using only one Ingenium wireless room-master per room and an Ingenium wearable wireless badge linked to an AI system with self-learning capability. This is accomplished through the interactive badge and room masters. In contrast, existing technology uses many sensors and requires off-line processing to train the activity recognizer and is not useable beyond laboratory environments. Additionally, no current commercial system has interactive planning and scheduling support. Ingenium will utilize the assistance of the AI lab staff at Washington State University which is an acknowledged leader in recognizing activities of daily living. Aim #1 will re-create the WSU technology, transfer activity knowledge to the Ingenium platform and enhance the platform with interactive self learning Aim #2 will outfit the WSU smart apartment with the Ingenium system. The smart apartment has a complex set of 37 sensors. The Ingenium system will both simplify and enhance the WSU configuration by utilizing only 7 Ingenium room-masters. Twenty students will participate in a study to verify that the Ingenium system provides superior activity location and recognition than the current wired multiple motion sensor system. Aim #3 will test the ability of the enhanced interactive prompting and learning capability of the Ingenium system to learn the same activities without the knowledge transfer hence validating a real time learning activity recognizer is possible in a commercializable system. One of goals of Ingenium's business plan is to commercialize this system. .      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.           This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant project is the development and pre-validation of the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt), a tiered testing strategy consisting of a battery of four alternative ocular irritancy assays, which will replace regulatory mandated acute ocular irritation testing using the Draize Rabbit Eye test. ROBatt consists of the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay (BCOP), the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay using 10-day fertile chicken eggs (CAMVA), the Porcine Corneal Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) and the Porcine Confocal Assay (PorFocal). This tiered strategy follows a decision tree that allows for a thorough interrogation of possible ocular irritants. Although four assays are recommended, in most cases only two or three will be used depending on the degree of irritation. The Specific Aim of the ROBatt project is to validate the decision tree variables using at least 50 chemicals listed in the European Center for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) data bank, including Corrosive (EEC R41, GHS/EPA Cat 1), Severe (EEC R36, GHS CaL 2, HMIS 2), Moderate (EPA Cat. 3, HMIS 2), Mild (HMIS 1) and Non-irritating (EPA Cat 4, HMIS 0). The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced. In most cases, these safety assessments are performed using the Draize Rabbit Eye test, resulting in thousands of rabbits used in testing every year.

"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,8059576,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,1244329,-0.011430395500099678
"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software for Mathematics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-Track application focuses on developing the first artificial intelligence (AI) educational software to teach developmental mathematics to the blind and visually impaired. This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for ""teaching tools"" and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for ""other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision."" The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology. Vertical Expansion of Accessible Features and Technological Capability 5) Implement Braille support in AI technology. 6) Develop additional AI tutor on Fractions that is automatically accessible from first principles using accessible AI framework. Evaluation of Accessible AI Educational Technology 7) Field evaluation of accessible AI technology with blind students and their instructors. 8) Continued demonstration and review of accessible AI technology by partners and other stakeholders. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH).

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.              Project Narrative Collaboration between malaria Branch of CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine to conduct research to improve the control of malaria in high risk populations, with a special emphasis on studies of the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia and Kenya.",Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01),8029719,U01CK000146,[' '],NCEZID,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2010,150000,-0.038057057644190616
"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,0.01723015429874533
"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders.

"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7808779,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,1249881,-0.011430395500099678
"Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant project is the development and pre-validation of the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt), a tiered testing strategy consisting of a battery of four alternative ocular irritancy assays, which will replace regulatory mandated acute ocular irritation testing using the Draize Rabbit Eye test. ROBatt consists of the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay (BCOP), the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay using 10-day fertile chicken eggs (CAMVA), the Porcine Corneal Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) and the Porcine Confocal Assay (PorFocal). This tiered strategy follows a decision tree that allows for a thorough interrogation of possible ocular irritants. Although four assays are recommended, in most cases only two or three will be used depending on the degree of irritation. The Specific Aim of the ROBatt project is to validate the decision tree variables using at least 50 chemicals listed in the European Center for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) data bank, including Corrosive (EEC R41, GHS/EPA Cat 1), Severe (EEC R36, GHS CaL 2, HMIS 2), Moderate (EPA Cat. 3, HMIS 2), Mild (HMIS 1) and Non-irritating (EPA Cat 4, HMIS 0). The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced.

"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Automated Biodosimetry The Unites States Government and Federal agencies have estimated that over 1 million people may seek information on their personal risk (radiation exposure level), if an event (such as a 10 kiloton detonation of an improvised nuclear device) occurs in a large metropolitan area. There will be a need for immediate triage and rapid cytogenetic biodosimetry for estimation of whole-body dose (<2Gy, 2-4Gy, >4Gy) of individuals within 48 hours, to determine and categorize the exposed cohorts for dose based stratification and effective medical management. Individuals exposed at levels exceeding 2 Gy will need immediate treatment and further evaluation with more sophisticated and precise dosimetry tools (such as devices, bioassays, biomarkers etc) to ascertain their absorbed dose.    Several of these established available assays are very labor intensive (demands skilled personnel; cytogeneticist) and time consuming (days to weeks), which serves to be a bane during a mass-casualty event. Effective medical management, response and treatment to the exposed cohort (within a short time window) can only be maximized and achieved with the aid of robotic tools and automated system. Automated cytogenetic systems can also reduce significant level of human error caused by fatigue due to the magnitude of samples to be processed. The Automated Cytogenetics Laboratory at AFRRI, focuses on automation of various classical biodosimerty assays (Dicentric Chromosomes, Micronuclei, PCC assays etc) to effectively enhance the throughput of sample analysis, thereby medical management. n/a",Automated Biodosimetry,8172179,1OD0505,"['Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cytogenetics', 'Devices', 'Dicentric chromosome', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Medical', 'Metaphase', 'Modeling', 'Nuclear', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'State Government', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'cohort', 'dosimetry', 'handheld mobile device', 'metropolitan', 'micronucleus', 'tool', 'treatment response']",OD,"OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH",Y01,2010,698597,-0.026431495072881516
"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software for Mathematics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-Track application focuses on developing the first artificial intelligence (AI) educational software to teach developmental mathematics to the blind and visually impaired. This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for ""teaching tools"" and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for ""other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision."" The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology. Vertical Expansion of Accessible Features and Technological Capability 5) Implement Braille support in AI technology. 6) Develop additional AI tutor on Fractions that is automatically accessible from first principles using accessible AI framework. Evaluation of Accessible AI Educational Technology 7) Field evaluation of accessible AI technology with blind students and their instructors. 8) Continued demonstration and review of accessible AI technology by partners and other stakeholders. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum already has long-term partnerships established with McGraw- Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as a major science education catalog company, CyberEd, Inc., a PLATO Learning Company.

"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7664538,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,318898,-0.02235574799450985
"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Clinical expertise on aging/motor control will be provided by Dr. Novak, from The Department of Neurology at BU School of Medicine, and through Dr. Wolf, from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta           n/a",Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic,7637376,R01HD050111,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurology', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'age related', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'neuroadaptation', 'neuromuscular system', 'new technology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2009,562835,-0.019801849536019912
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions.

"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production. It will be useful to clinicians for assessing the degree of dysfunction in upper motoneuron diseases such as Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Stroke, and other disorders.              n/a",Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior,7675312,R01NS058250,"['Action Potentials', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'International', 'Left', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microgravity', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fibers', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Needles', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right-On', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Space Medicine', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'neuromuscular system', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'new technology', 'non-invasive system', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology/technique']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R01,2009,446520,-0.01666315308905122

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7847964,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nose', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2009,11376,0.0009256394470927027
"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7616844,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,1255061,-0.011430395500099678
"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.          n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR),7404392,R44EY016251,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Purpose', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Special Education', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Students', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'commercialization', 'concept', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'physical science', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'science education', 'simulation', 'success', 'teacher', 'technological innovation', 'virtual']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R44,2008,383858,0.008231699612584466
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support.

"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus. The proposed studies will investigate the possibility to reverse this situation and take advantage of advanced technologies for adapting the control apparatus to the residual skills of the patients. n/a",Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device,7488480,R21HD053608,"['Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Development', 'Elbow', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Head', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quadriplegia', 'Residual state', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wrist', 'base', 'body sense', 'computer generated', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'independent component analysis', 'motor learning', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R21,2008,98314,-0.00759229570724505
"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7489819,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2008,637604,0.01723015429874533
"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders. The successful development of this technology will be transferred for commercial development with the financial assistance of the Massachusetts Community Technology Foundation.         n/a",Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function,7482475,R01EB007163,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Body Surface', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hybrids', 'Inherited Spinocerebellar Degenerations', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Levodopa', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neurologist', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Principal Investigator', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Week', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized data processing', 'day', 'design', 'diaries', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2008,637832,0.010846418495658948
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production. It will be useful to clinicians for assessing the degree of dysfunction in upper motoneuron diseases such as Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Stroke, and other disorders.              n/a",Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior,7489322,R01NS058250,"['Action Potentials', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'International', 'Invasive', 'Left', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microgravity', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fibers', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Needles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right-On', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Space Medicine', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'neuromuscular system', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'new technology', 'non-invasive system', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology/technique']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R01,2008,455129,-0.01666315308905122
"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7459910,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2008,118789,-0.016776954674436375
"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7537117,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Compatible', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,97690,0.0009256394470927027
"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7409622,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Models', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'USA Georgia', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,1249160,-0.011430395500099678
"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to develop a compact inexpensive alternative to the bulky expensive touchpads now required by blind people for audio/touch access to graphical information. Audio/touch is known to provide excellent access to computer-literate blind people as well as people with dyslexia or other severe print disabilities. Preparing Audio/touch materials was very expensive until ViewPlus introduced the IVEO Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) Authoring/conversion software in 2005. IVEO permits virtually any graphical information to be created or converted/imported easily to a well- structured highly accessible SVG format. Tactile copy was also very expensive before 2000 when ViewPlus introduced the Tiger embossing Windows printers that ""print"" by embossing. The new ViewPlus Emprint printer/embossers emboss and also print color images, creating color tactile images particularly useful for people with dyslexia and a number of other print disabilities. An audio/touch user reads an IVEO SVG graphic using the free IVEO Viewer, a tactile copy of the image, and a touchpad. The user places the tactile graphic on the touchpad and presses a point of interest. The touchpad communicates the position of that point back to the computer, and the IVEO Viewer speaks the appropriate information. Tactile text made from mainstream graphics has a distinctive pattern. When a user presses, that text is spoken by the IVEO Viewer. When the user presses a graphic object having a SVG title within the file, that title will be spoken. Objects may also have arbitrarily long description fields that can be spoken and browsed. All spoken information can be displayed on an attached braille display if desired. Graphical information is ubiquitous today, but almost none is accessible to blind people. Government agencies, libraries, companies, and agencies serving people with disabilities could easily send highly accessible IVEO graphics files and tactile graphic copies to clients with disabilities, but there is a ""chicken and egg"" dilemma that must be overcome before they are likely to do so. Few blind people have a touchpad (which cost $500 or more), so few could use that information. The specific aim of this Phase I proposal is to develop an affordable webcam-based prototype as an alternative to touchpads. It is based on an inexpensive webcam that is focused on the graphic and follows a finger. A touchpad press is emulated in this prototype by pressing some computer key with the other hand. This project could be the key to bringing accessible graphics to all blind computer users and is clearly of interest to NEI whose mission statement includes mental health and quality of life of blind people. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal is relevant to the mission of the National Eye Institute, because it could be the key to making nearly all graphical information easily accessible to people who are blind or have other severe print disabilities. Graphical information is ubiquitous in the world today but is not presently accessible to blind people except through expensive and time-consuming conversion by trained transcribers. Making all graphical information accessible would have an obviously highly beneficial direct effect on education and professional opportunities, mental health, and quality of life of blind people. Mental health and quality of life issues for blind people are parts of the mission of the National Eye Institute.          n/a",Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People,7480812,R43EY018973,"['Back', 'Braille Display', 'Businesses', 'Chickens', 'Client', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Dyslexia', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Eye Institute', 'Numbers', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Printing', 'Professional Education', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of finger', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tigers', 'Time', 'Title', 'Today', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'desire', 'digital', 'disability', 'egg', 'interest', 'literate', 'print disabilities', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'touchpad', 'vector']",NEI,"VIEWPLUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2008,100001,-0.025665054248185576
"Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes the development of an indoor way-finding device utilizing the unique magnetic anomaly patterns that exist in modern, man-made structures. The proposed system will record the magnitude of magnetic field strength from sensors in three orthogonal axes. The time history of these magnetic data points can be continuously compared with an electronic map of magnetic anomalies (or, ""signature"") to determine current position within a building. The phase I developed prototype system tracked in feasibility experiments with an accuracy of 1 foot (radius). Magnetic anomalies render a magnetic compass useless for finding a directional bearing. However, these same invisible anomalies represent valuable, unique indoor terrain features measurable by magnetic sensors located inside a small, portable device. Such a device would be able to provide low-vision users with a valuable indoor low-cost way-finding tool analogous to a Global Positioning System (GPS) device used outdoors. About 3.7 million Americans are visually disabled. Of these, 200,000 are blind, and the rest have low vision. The key advantage of the way-finding concept presented in this proposal, over other methods, is that the benefits are made available to the visually impaired community without requiring expensive building infrastructure investments. This is of particular advantage to large government buildings and educational campuses. The proposed approach allows a cost effective solution to way-finding within these buildings.          n/a",Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired,7477498,R44EY015616,"['American', 'Appointment', 'Building Codes', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Funding', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Location', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Electronics', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Oceans', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Services', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solutions', 'Somatotype', 'Speech', 'Steel', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'blind', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'court', 'design', 'digital', 'foot', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'miniaturize', 'motor control', 'performance tests', 'professor', 'prototype', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'sensor', 'sensory integration', 'tool', 'way finding']",NEI,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2008,365248,-0.01583261352400382

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7389728,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2008,373102,-0.024337478271477718
"Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of automated planar patch clamp instruments over the past two years has increased the throughput of voltage clamp ion channel assays by a factor of at least ten. This is possible because the automated systems can perform assays in parallel using16 and 384-well plates. While the drug discovery industry has embraced this new technology, the enthusiasm has been tempered by the modest success rates of the assays and by the high cost of the consumable patch substrate. Currently, typical success rates for a standard ion channel assay, using, for example, the Q-Patch from Sophion Biosciences, the Port-a-Patch system from Nanion Biosciences, or the PatchXpress from Molecular Devices Corp., is around 50%. In other words, for every16 channel chip used in these systems, only eight will produce useable data. This effectively doubles the price of each data point over what is ideally possible. In order for a planar patch clamp experiment to succeed, several events need to occur (assuming that the cell expresses the appropriate ion channels in functional states): the cell of interest must form a high-resistance seal with the planar substrate, the whole-cell configuration must be achieved, and fluidic pathways must be intact so that compounds of interest maybe applied to the cell. A failure of anyone of these steps will result in no data collected from that well. We propose to optimize the first two steps in this process, namely, seal formation and entry into whole-cell recording configuration. We will use machine learning approaches to examine how a human patch clamp expert interacts with the patch clamp system in order to develop a model that will provide parameters that can be used to more efficiently and successfully provide useable whole-cell recording configuration. It is important to note that the model that we derive from our approach will not actually copy what the expert does, but will attempt to optimize the process based on cues that mayor may not be consciously monitored by the expert. The Specific Aims of the Phase I component will be to: (1) integrate recording capabilities into existing automated patch clamp software from Nanion, (2) evaluate the success rate of the procedure specified by our machine learning analysis, and (3) develop stand-alone software for use specifically with manual patch clamp setups and for exploration of the potential benefits of using machine learning via expert training in other applications. In Phase II we propose to develop the proof-of-concept software into a user-friendly commercial software module which we will offer to existing and potential automated patch clamp companies. We will also simplify and streamline the user interface of this software as a stand-alone component for manual patch clamp systems. Developing drugs that target ion channels has been hindered by the expense of the consumables used in automated patch clamp screening devices. We propose to develop a method, using machine learning techniques which may increase the success rate of these instruments and therefore lower the overall cost of ion channel drug discovery.          n/a",Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps,7220448,R43EB007148,"['Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Employee Strikes', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cell type', 'concept', 'cost', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'programs', 'research study', 'seal', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'voltage', 'voltage clamp']",NIBIB,BLATZ SCIENTIFIC,R43,2007,199389,-0.04469597379274699
"Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Self- monitoring of all foods and beverages consumed is central to weight loss and maintenance efforts; however, this places a heavy burden on the user. These same burdens also impede nutritional research. The proposed research is for the testing of a semi-automated, objective, near real-time computer vision and pattern recognition approach to the measurement of dietary intake. In the proposed product, cell phone pictures of meals and snacks will be analyzed by software in an attempt to automatically recognize as many items as possible. A small number of intelligent yes/no questions will help provide additional information when necessary in order to meet the accuracy demands of the target application. Following identification of the items, the software will estimate the portion sizes of all identified items. The experiments comprising this Phase I SBIR are (a) extract the most informative sets of features using a large number of food and beverage items taken from an existing database of real world meal images, (b) compare the accuracy of candidate pattern recognition approaches to identify items based on the extracted features, (c) identify the most feasible algorithms for estimating portion size, and (d) test usability and user acceptance with a simulated version of the product. Phase II will (a) apply the approach to a greater variety of food and beverage items, (b) improve automated analysis, and (c) compare the approach to existing assessment instruments.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.          n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR),7220194,R44EY016251,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Purpose', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Special Education', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Students', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'commercialization', 'concept', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'physical science', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'science education', 'simulation', 'success', 'teacher', 'technological innovation', 'virtual']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R44,2007,366168,0.008231699612584466
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7242352,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review, Systematic (PT)', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH AND SCI UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,292133,-0.02235574799450985
"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7287365,R44AG024687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Copyright', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Outsourcing', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Privacy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'network models', 'patient home care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2007,378793,-0.019122828492801235
"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus. The proposed studies will investigate the possibility to reverse this situation and take advantage of advanced technologies for adapting the control apparatus to the residual skills of the patients.       n/a",Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device,7258179,R21HD053608,"['Accidents', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Asia', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elbow', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quadriplegia', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wrist', 'base', 'body sense', 'computer generated', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'disability', 'healthy volunteer', 'independent component analysis', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'motor learning', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO,R21,2007,225323,-0.00731397107282454
"The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to create software that uses mathematical algorithms to detect medical billing coding errors prior to payment. The well-publicized failure of current healthcare cost containment technologies to prevent improper payments in both the commercial healthcare market and the federal Medicare program highlights the urgent need for a new approach to the growing problem of out of control medical costs. A recent federal study by the GAO estimated that improper payments by Medicare alone were in excess of 21 billion dollars, a truly staggering 48.1 percent of all improper payments by federal programs. Like SPAM, whose dynamic nature makes static or post hoc remedies ineffective, effective cost containment in one area often merely leads to the creation of new areas of abuse. Clearly, the ideal solution is a system that can evaluate the fairness of payments before they are made, and that can respond to dynamic patterns of abuse. The first step in creating such a system is the creation of robust method for sorting bills for appropriate rule-based analysis on the basis of the type of bill. Currently neither Medicare nor major insurers are capable of making this classification reliably except through the use of inefficient, static rules and the use of manual sorting--a costly and inefficient approach to assuring timely payment to hospitals and medical providers. We propose a novel method for using mathematical algorithms that utilize machine-learning (ML) methods to address the problem of medical bill categorization, the first step in coding error detection. Specifically, we propose the evaluation of a variety of genetic algorithms that are well adapted to the problems of large, dynamic datasets and can be ""trained"" using real world correctly coded datasets in healthcare claims. This work is particularly timely due to recent Medicare contracting reform. Using more than 50 contractors and carriers, bill classification is largely determined by the carrier's contract. Centralizing this process to only four payment centers will require the classification system we propose. [This research is directed toward the development of software applications that will detect billing errors and perform proper edits to payment of medical bills. Current anticipated changes and reforms in the Medicare system will require these systems, which do not currently exist in the public or private sector.]             n/a",The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments,7316071,R43LM009190,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contractor', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Fraud', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Industry', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'mathematical algorithm', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'software development', 'stem', 'success']",NLM,"QMEDTRIX SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2007,92482,-0.018942907214097273
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration .By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wirelessaccelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at thehip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometerswill be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permiting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders. The successful development of this technology will be transferred for commercial development with the financial assistance of the Massachusetts Community Technology Foundation.         n/a",Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function,7285272,R01EB007163,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Body Surface', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hybrids', 'Inherited Spinocerebellar Degenerations', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Levodopa', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neurologist', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Principal Investigator', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Week', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized data processing', 'day', 'design', 'diaries', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2007,617760,0.010846418495658948
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production. It will be useful to clinicians for assessing the degree of dysfunction in upper motoneuron diseases such as Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Stroke, and other disorders.              n/a",Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior,7280742,R01NS058250,"['Action Potentials', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'International', 'Invasive', 'Left', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microgravity', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fibers', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Needles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right-On', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Space Medicine', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'neuromuscular system', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'new technology', 'non-invasive system', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology/technique']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R01,2007,441010,-0.01666315308905122
"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7252088,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2007,276104,-0.016776954674436375

"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7125319,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Models', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'USA Georgia', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2007,1322181,-0.011430395500099678
"A Laser-Based Device for Work Site Stability Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary: A laser-based acoustic emission (AE) detection device is proposed for work site structural stability assessment. This new device will take advantage of innovations in laser ultrasonics, artificial intelligence (Al) and advanced acoustic emission technology to provide mine workers with a unique instant, real time stability assessment of immediate rock structures in the working environment, which was not attainable in the past. Nonlinear optical interferometry based on two-wave mixing / photo-induced electromotive force techniques will be used for AE signal detection from rock structures in mine sites. Al criteria will be established by wave pattern recognition to identify unstable areas in mine sites. This research will also result in a unique non-contact monitoring device for acoustic emission/microseismic studies, which will be very useful in many areas of application. The primary objective of the Phase II research is to develop the prototype of the AE detector and test it in real-world mining facilities. The primary objective consists of six specific aims: 1. instrumentation development, 2. pre-field experiment preparation, 3. in-situ data collection, 4. Al criteria development, 5. system integration and in-situ trial, and 6. documentation and reporting. Relevance to Public Health: The innovation will contribute to a reduction the occupational injuries and fatalities caused by roof falls, sidewall crumples, stope collapses, and slope slides, etc., in the mining industry.

"Smart Wheelchair Component System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Independent mobility is critical to individuals of any age. While the needs of many individuals with disabilities can be satisfied with power wheelchairs, some members of the disabled community find it difficult or impossible to operate a standard power wheelchair. This population includes, but is not limited to, individuals with low vision, visual field neglect, spasticity, tremors, or cognitive deficits. The goal of this project is to develop a set of components that can be added to standard power wheelchairs to convert them into ""smart"" wheelchairs which can assist the user in navigation and obstacle avoidance. During Phase I, a prototype of the Smart Wheelchair Component System (SWCS) was developed from a laptop computer and a collection of sonar, infrared and bump sensors. The evaluation activities performed during Phase I demonstrated that the system is compatible with multiple brands of wheelchairs, can accept both continuous and switch-based input, and can support front-, mid-, and rear-wheel drive wheelchairs. During Phase II, we propose to refine the system hardware and software; replace the laptop computer with an embedded microprocessor; fabricate enclosures for the system components; and develop tools to support clinicians in installing and configuring the system. The system will be evaluated in tests involving potential users, clinicians, and wheelchair design standards. The final product will be a market-ready modular system which can be attached to a variety of standard power wheelchairs. This product has the potential to increase the independence and quality of life of many wheelchair users and potential wheelchair users whose disabilities limit their capacity for independent wheelchair navigation.       n/a",Smart Wheelchair Component System,7237214,R44HD040023,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Child', 'Client', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disadvantaged', 'Documentation', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Joystick', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microprocessor', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Self Perception', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Travel', 'Tremor', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'laptop', 'member', 'neglect', 'peer', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sonar', 'tool']",NICHD,AT SCIENCES,R44,2007,387828,-0.023371183237704336
"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR) Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed. FIVR has the potential to establish a method of highly accurate dietary intake assessment suitable for cost-effective use at the population level, and thereby advance crucial public health objectives. n/a",Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR),7490204,U01HL091738,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Diet Research', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Electronics', 'Energy Intake', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Film', 'Food', 'Food Patterns', 'Frequencies', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Questionnaires', 'Reliance', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Water', 'base', 'cost', 'experience', 'feeding', 'graphical user interface', 'innovative technologies', 'novel', 'programs', 'size', 'speech recognition', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voice recognition', 'ward']",NHLBI,"VIOCARE, INC.",U01,2007,3000,-0.009047102536562211

We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed. FIVR has the potential to establish a method of highly accurate dietary intake assessment suitable for cost-effective use at the population level, and thereby advance crucial public health objectives.             n/a",Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR),7340845,U01HL091738,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Diet Research', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Electronics', 'Energy Intake', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Film', 'Food', 'Food Patterns', 'Frequencies', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Questionnaires', 'Reliance', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Water', 'base', 'cost', 'experience', 'feeding', 'graphical user interface', 'innovative technologies', 'novel', 'programs', 'size', 'speech recognition', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voice recognition', 'ward']",NHLBI,"VIOCARE, INC.",U01,2007,1039742,-0.008440215203521284
"Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes the development of an indoor way-finding device utilizing the unique magnetic anomaly patterns that exist in modern, man-made structures. The proposed system will record the magnitude of magnetic field strength from sensors in three orthogonal axes. The time history of these magnetic data points can be continuously compared with an electronic map of magnetic anomalies (or, ""signature"") to determine current position within a building. The phase I developed prototype system tracked in feasibility experiments with an accuracy of 1 foot (radius). Magnetic anomalies render a magnetic compass useless for finding a directional bearing. However, these same invisible anomalies represent valuable, unique indoor terrain features measurable by magnetic sensors located inside a small, portable device. Such a device would be able to provide low-vision users with a valuable indoor low-cost way-finding tool analogous to a Global Positioning System (GPS) device used outdoors. About 3.7 million Americans are visually disabled. Of these, 200,000 are blind, and the rest have low vision. The key advantage of the way-finding concept presented in this proposal, over other methods, is that the benefits are made available to the visually impaired community without requiring expensive building infrastructure investments. This is of particular advantage to large government buildings and educational campuses. The proposed approach allows a cost effective solution to way-finding within these buildings.          n/a",Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired,7326673,R44EY015616,"['American', 'Appointment', 'Building Codes', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Funding', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Location', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Electronics', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Oceans', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Services', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solutions', 'Somatotype', 'Speech', 'Steel', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'blind', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'court', 'design', 'digital', 'foot', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'miniaturize', 'motor control', 'performance tests', 'professor', 'prototype', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'sensor', 'sensory integration', 'tool', 'way finding']",NEI,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2007,386674,-0.01583261352400382

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7209749,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2007,430160,-0.024337478271477718
"A Laser-Based Device for Work Site Stability Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary: A laser-based acoustic emission (AE) detection device is proposed for work site structural stability assessment. This new device will take advantage of innovations in laser ultrasonics, artificial intelligence (Al) and advanced acoustic emission technology to provide mine workers with a unique instant, real time stability assessment of immediate rock structures in the working environment, which was not attainable in the past. Nonlinear optical interferometry based on two-wave mixing / photo-induced electromotive force techniques will be used for AE signal detection from rock structures in mine sites. Al criteria will be established by wave pattern recognition to identify unstable areas in mine sites. This research will also result in a unique non-contact monitoring device for acoustic emission/microseismic studies, which will be very useful in many areas of application. The primary objective of the Phase II research is to develop the prototype of the AE detector and test it in real-world mining facilities. The primary objective consists of six specific aims: 1. instrumentation development, 2. pre-field experiment preparation, 3. in-situ data collection, 4. Al criteria development, 5. system integration and in-situ trial, and 6. documentation and reporting. Relevance to Public Health: The innovation will contribute to a reduction the occupational injuries and fatalities caused by roof falls, sidewall crumples, stope collapses, and slope slides, etc., in the mining industry. The research and development addresses the miner's safety and contributes to ensuring the mineworker's right to ""safe and healthful working conditions"" (Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970).          n/a",A Laser-Based Device for Work Site Stability Assessment,7109905,R44OH007662,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human mortality', 'injury prevention', 'interferometry', 'lasers', 'mechanical stress', 'minings', 'monitoring device', 'occupational hazard', 'occupational health /safety', 'sound perception', 'technology /technique development', 'ultrasonography', 'work site']",NIOSH,AAC INTERNATIONAL,R44,2006,386471,0.013765049626190238
"INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES   A common feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurological movement disorders is that the peripheral neuromuscular system remains intact. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers the potential to restore movement in these individuals. Impressive improvements in electrode and sensor hardware have recently been made, but development of control algorithms for complex dynamic movements remains difficult.      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique from artificial intelligence that has the potential to overcome this problem. A RL-based control system learns from experience how to control movement, in very much the same way as an infant. The system receives information from multiple sensors, as well as a reward signal, and generates actions, i.e. muscle stiimulation levels, that are initially random. The system will learn to predict the consequences of its actions and will ultimately converge to a control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time. An essential feature of RL is that the control strategy is not created by the designer, but is learned from experience. This learning process could ultimately result in motor behavior of much higher quality than can be achieved with traditionally designed feedback control systems, which tend to ""fight"" rather than exploit the natural dynamics of the body such as inertia, pendulum and mass-spring mechanisms. Furthermore, a self learning system has the advantage that it can adapt itself to the user's body mass, muscle strength, as well as variations in electrode location.      The long-term goal is a system that integrates high-level commands from the user with signals from implanted sensors to produce intelligent and adaptive motor function. Feasibility of this concept will be tested here for FES control of six muscles in the upper extremity, to perform the task of reaching in the horizontal plane. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Implementation of RL control on a virtual arm with computer-generated commands and rewards, (2) RL control on a virtual arm, with commands and rewards given by a human operator, and (3) RL control of muscles in a paralyzed arm in two subjects with high cervical spinal cord injury, with commands and rewards given by the user via a head tracker based input device. n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES,7085349,R21HD049662,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'electrodes', 'electrostimulus', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'neuromuscular stimulator', 'neuroregulation', 'spinal cord injury']",NICHD,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COL/MED-CWRU,R21,2006,192359,-0.02518448425794471
"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.      The Phase II work plan has three tracks: 1) Computer vision software development and testing, 2) Human interface design and development, and 3) development and testing of the two forms of the device.

"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7051911,R44AG024687,"['aging', 'artificial intelligence', 'assistive device /technology', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'caregivers', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'confidentiality', 'frail elderly', 'functional ability', 'home health care', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'monitoring device', 'outpatient care', 'quality of life', 'safety equipment', 'self care', 'technology /technique development']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2006,361154,-0.019122828492801235
"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial.

The principal aim of this SBIR Competing Continuation Phase II Proposal for a Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making is to complete the development of its Quality Donor System(tm) (QDS) and to secure ongoing 510(k) clearances for it from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologies Evaluation and Research (CBER) for implementation and evaluation of the total system in blood centers and hospital blood banks.      The research is based on continuing development of the Quality Donor System and deploying it in regional blood centers and hospital blood banks. System use by donors and staff and user satisfaction will be measured and analyzed to assess success. Blood safety is enhanced by eliminating FDA-reportable errors and by increasing blood donor honesty in disclosing risky behaviors. Blood availability is enhanced by increasing donor satisfaction, resulting in higher return rates for new blood donors and increasing employer sponsorship of blood drives. n/a",Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making,7127266,R44HL072635,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blood bank /supply contamination', 'blood donor', 'case history', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'decision making', 'human subject', 'interview', 'nonEnglish language', 'patient safety /medical error', 'phlebotomy']",NHLBI,"TALISMAN, LTD",R44,2006,927498,-0.0034928708771609996
"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process. The virtual PCR will become a quantitative tool point-of-care diagnosis of a wide variety of heritable and infectious diseases. The virtues of the intelligent vortex tube PCRJet are: speed, versatility, reliability, portability and low cost.         n/a",Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software,7243612,R33RR020219,"['DNA', 'artificial intelligence', 'bacterial DNA', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical equipment development', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnostic tests', 'mathematical model', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid amplification techniques', 'nucleic acid purification', 'nucleic acid quantitation /detection', 'optics', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'virus DNA']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R33,2006,350636,-0.017885381746687766
"An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a recognized need for specific and reliable information regarding the dose/response relationships between physical activity and health for all segments of the population. New methods for assessing physical activity and energy expenditure (EE) in free-living populations are needed before a systematic evaluation and interpretation of these dose-response relationships between physical activity and specific health-related results can be undertaken. Our objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, unobtrusive acceleration pattern acquisition and analysis system. This instrument will identify and quantify the physical activities that generate these patterns. At the end of this program, we will provide an intelligent system that is practical from both a cost and unobtrusive use prospective, thus making it an instrument of choice for epidemiologic physical activity studies of large free-living populations.           n/a",An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor,7107376,R43HD051014,"['actigraphy', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'body movement', 'body physical activity', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'cost effectiveness', 'exercise', 'human subject', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'miniature biomedical equipment', 'oxygen consumption', 'patient monitoring device', 'personal log /diary', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemetry', 'videotape /videodisc']",NICHD,"CREARE, INC.",R43,2006,122046,0.00027336186043303294
"Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop EMS/IM ITS, a suite of simulation-based intelligent tutoring systems and scenarios that will enable practice-based learning of WMD emergency medical services incident management principles and skills, including situation assessment, decision-making, and real-time execution of EMS tasks within an incident command structure. To support practical and economical development of many EMS/IM ITS training scenarios, we will also develop software tools and development methods that enable efficient authoring of new scenarios and adaptation/enhancement of existing scenarios by instructors or subject matter experts, without programming. We will leverage our tutoring system development tools and our experience developing tutoring systems for medical training, command and control, and tactical decision-making. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) was mandated by HSPD-5 to provide a comprehensive, national approach to domestic incident management, so that all levels of government across the nation could work efficiently and effectively together to prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. We believe that EMS/IM ITS can contribute to NIMS by providing scenario-based learning of incident management principles for medical first responders, consistent with NIMS, and tailorable via scenario authoring to the specific circumstances and incident management plans of each government organization. This proposed Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for the Phase II effort, by producing 1) requirements and design of the system to be developed during Phase II, 2) a software prototype that illustrates our concept, and 3) a formative evaluation of the prototype and design that provides a basis for estimating the feasibility and effectiveness of the operational system that would be developed during Phase II.             n/a",Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management,7115108,R43ES014801,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'emergency service /first responder', 'health care personnel education', 'health care professional practice', 'health services research tag', 'medical education', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'training']",NIEHS,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2006,99999,0.004755018951925476
"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures. n/a",Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures,7109311,R44NS039214,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'brain electrical activity', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient monitoring device', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,"CHATTEN ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2006,400929,-0.0072812117934368615
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,7109222,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2006,483334,-0.018985080592746117
"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders. The successful development of this technology will be transferred for commercial development with the financial assistance of the Massachusetts Community Technology Foundation.         n/a",Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function,7010950,R01EB007163,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'clinical research', 'fingers', 'gait', 'limbs']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,619987,0.010846418495658948

"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production. It will be useful to clinicians for assessing the degree of dysfunction in upper motoneuron diseases such as Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Stroke, and other disorders.              n/a",Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior,7132833,R01NS058250,"['action potentials', 'behavior', 'clinical research', 'community', 'electrodes', 'muscle', 'training']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R01,2006,427941,-0.01666315308905122
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantum has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the first artificial intelligence (Al) tutoring systems in chemistry education. This work successfully addressed several longstanding, clearly articulated needs for improved interactive educational software. A leading distributor for the U.S. and Canada, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories, as well as prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, have entered into long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. The aim of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to bring the full power and benefits of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired. There is a considerable need for improved educational software for science education in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind is known to be particularly acute. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum Al Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind using Internet-capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation here is the development of advanced Al tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the first Al tutoring systems that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. A formulation of an Al tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. This project can only be accomplished by working intimately with experts in education for the blind, and Quantum has arranged a number of important partnerships in this respect, for research as well as commercialization of the resulting technology, including: the National Federation of the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, Pearson Learning Group, Bartimaeus Group and Henter Mathematics. n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software,6880607,R43EY016251,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blind aid', 'chemistry', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'educational resource design /development', 'science education', 'technology /technique development']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2005,100721,0.001133427357336829
"INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES   A common feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurological movement disorders is that the peripheral neuromuscular system remains intact. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers the potential to restore movement in these individuals. Impressive improvements in electrode and sensor hardware have recently been made, but development of control algorithms for complex dynamic movements remains difficult.      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique from artificial intelligence that has the potential to overcome this problem. A RL-based control system learns from experience how to control movement, in very much the same way as an infant. The system receives information from multiple sensors, as well as a reward signal, and generates actions, i.e. muscle stiimulation levels, that are initially random. The system will learn to predict the consequences of its actions and will ultimately converge to a control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time. An essential feature of RL is that the control strategy is not created by the designer, but is learned from experience. This learning process could ultimately result in motor behavior of much higher quality than can be achieved with traditionally designed feedback control systems, which tend to ""fight"" rather than exploit the natural dynamics of the body such as inertia, pendulum and mass-spring mechanisms. Furthermore, a self learning system has the advantage that it can adapt itself to the user's body mass, muscle strength, as well as variations in electrode location.      The long-term goal is a system that integrates high-level commands from the user with signals from implanted sensors to produce intelligent and adaptive motor function. Feasibility of this concept will be tested here for FES control of six muscles in the upper extremity, to perform the task of reaching in the horizontal plane. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Implementation of RL control on a virtual arm with computer-generated commands and rewards, (2) RL control on a virtual arm, with commands and rewards given by a human operator, and (3) RL control of muscles in a paralyzed arm in two subjects with high cervical spinal cord injury, with commands and rewards given by the user via a head tracker based input device. n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES,6908435,R21HD049662,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'electrodes', 'electrostimulus', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'neuromuscular stimulator', 'neuroregulation', 'spinal cord injury']",NICHD,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COL/MED-CWRU,R21,2005,164156,-0.02518448425794471
"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.

The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.

Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6924688,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2005,167063,-0.043343472584586006
"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation. Collection of a subscription fee will be used to support the maintenance and future development of the system. n/a","Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT)",6990440,R43HD049229,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'family', 'focus groups', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'social service']",NICHD,"KIT SOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2005,104545,-0.014391267208673083
"Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant)  The overall goal of the proposal is to improve ambulatory and long-term EEG monitoring using an innovative wireless EEG system. The specific aim of this proposal is to develop an ambulatory wireless EEG monitoring system with real-time adaptive and re-configuration capabilities, which will allow more clinical data to be transmitted in the same bandwidth and in a small portable package. The proposed device will adapt its data acquisition hardware to the underlying clinical event permitting it to focus its high transmission rates to periods of clinically relevant events. The events will be detected by our powerful seizure monitor algorithm which will have direct control over a flexible and innovative hardware. The result is enhanced wireless EEG in a small package, low power and with data quality comparable to bulkier clinical tethered system. The ability to optimize bandwidth is timely due to new FDA telemetry guidelines, which restricts the availability of frequencies and bandwidths in medical devices. Another advantage to optimizing output is that more meaningful data can be created without excessively large data files, which will speed analysis and review. Finally, the proposed device will be able to dynamically reconfigure itself in real time to compensate for serious data-corrupting events such as when one or several electrodes become loose or detached. In summary, the two major innovations are: 1- Real-time adaptive capability for adjusting the quantity and quality of the acquired and transmitted EEG data to better reflect the underlying clinical event (such as a seizure), 2- more practical and accurate ambulatory monitoring by the real-time automatic reconfiguration of the EEG acquisition system.       In Phase I, we designed, fabricated and tested a prototype system. Bench top and clinical testing showed that the system can indeed modify its output in response to artifacts or changes in EEG morphology. In Phase II, we will complete development including a radio design that meets the new FDA guidelines, and test on long-term patients with epilepsy.               n/a",Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG,6952455,R44NS042999,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electrodes', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemedicine', 'telemetry']",NINDS,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R44,2005,671838,0.004888805856687452
"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects. During Phase II, the pressurization capabilities of the new probe will be further developed and examined. The optimal probe designed will be implemented along with the optimal noise cancellation algorithm and tested in a comprehensive clinical study incorporating the pressurization capabilities of the probe. n/a",Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition,6933674,R43DC007543,"['adult human (21+)', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'ear disorder diagnosis', 'infant human (0-1 year)', 'mathematics', 'noise', 'otoacoustic emission', 'sound frequency']",NIDCD,INTELLIGENT HEARING SYSTEMS,R43,2005,100000,-0.0038416423458384145
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.  Commercial applications include marketing to healthcare  providers, namely managed care organizations, and employers who share the burden of  healthcare expenses.  n/a",Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management,6859455,R44HL070549,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior therapy', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dietary lipid', 'health education', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrient intake activity', 'patient oriented research', 'weight control', 'weight loss']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2005,207836,-0.049543602400568584

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample. The design is       a 4-group (Control, Modular Expert System intervention, Telecommunications           Intervention, Integrated Expert System Intervention) x 3 occasions (0, 12, and       24 months).

"A Run-to-Run Algorithm for Glucose Regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long term objective of this work is to develop new algorithmic approaches to optimize the delivery of insulin in an automated fashion to people with type 1 diabetes. Specifically, we aim to develop a strategy, inspired by run-to-run control theory established by the chemical process industries, that ""learns"" from the previous sequence of glucose responses to insulin dosing (over the course of days), and optimally predicts the appropriate strategy for the forthcoming day. The notion of a ""cycle"" in engineering will be extended to manage the 24 hour routine of repeated meals, activities, and sleep cycles and the corresponding dosing of insulin. The algorithm will be tested in both simulation and clinical trials for robustness to sensor noise, uncertainty in the patient characterization, variability in the timing of the postprandial glucose peak, and variability in the carbohydrate content in the meals. The Specific Aims of this project are to: i) construct predictive patient sensitivity models for calculation of optimal insulin dosing from elevated (or depressed) glucose levels, ii) develop run-to-run algorithm for insulin bolus dosing to provide corrections in subsequent days based on previous history of glucose levels and insulin dosage, and iii) evaluate the robustness of the algorithm through meal challenges of varying carbohydrate content. The aims will blend prototype algorithms that are drawn from systems engineering with validation in a series of clinical tests. The proposed collaboration between systems engineers and renowned diabetes researchers in an established clinical research setting will allow a novel fusion of methods that can be truly characterized as ""innovative"". The medical collaborators in the proposal are located at the prestigious Sansum Medical Research Institute, which is located less than 10 miles from the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment.

"Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Precollege science education, particularly middle school where students first encounter courses dedicated to the sciences, has lacked the attention of the scientific and education communities. As a result, many middle level teachers are marginally prepared to teach contemporary science, the development of effective curricular materials has lagged, and schools devote inadequate resources and support to science. In the prior Phase I grant, experiment modules have been designed by scientists that address the core content of middle school Life Science. They utilize live (aquatic) organisms in the class room to stimulate inquiry into the properties of living organisms and make connections with related environmental health problems to link student learning with the world around them. Human environmental health was chosen as the biomedical context because it strongly relates to the macroscopic world in which middle school students live and provides age-appropriate learning opportunities for students as they begin to understand organisms and their underlying structures and mechanisms. During Phase II our specific objectives are 1. To infuse middle school Life Science education with attractive experiment modules that stress student inquiry. 2. To mount a comprehensive dissemination program with school systems that work with large numbers of minorities and students from families with lower socioeconomic status. 3. To utilize a 'train the trainer' method for lead teachers to achieve wide dissemination of the modules that involves close collaboration between scientists and educators and the lead teachers. 4.

"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6942725,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2005,483683,-0.018985080592746117
"Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system that can automatically detect bouts of moderate or greater walking and deliver health behavior change information to users to increase their levels of physical activity will be developed and evaluated. The system will be an extension of work already performed by the investigators, and will incorporate a validated wireless motion sensor, pattern classification software to identify bouts of walking, and a personified, relational user interface designed to maintain engagement and trust in the tailored behavior change information delivered to users over multiple interactions. The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.       In the proposed effort the components of the PDA-based system will be developed, integrated and tested, and a randomized pilot study conducted to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the PDA-based behavior change intervention for increasing walking; 2) evaluate the effect of timeliness of health behavior change information on walking (time of need vs. retrospective); and 3) compare the efficacy of the personified user interface with that of a text-based interface for delivering health behavior change information on a PDA.      The proposed work will make significant contributions to several areas within the science of medical informatics, extending and integrating work in knowledge representation, bio-signal analysis, natural language processing, and consumer health informatics. This research will advance our understanding of the role of time in health behavior change, and result in a model of the temporal relationships among sensor data, user behavior, user goals, and the delivery of health information intended to change behavior. n/a",Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption,7127056,R21LM008553,[' '],NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,105924,-0.02661555559965611

"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Development of Ultrasonic Appratus for Dental Diagnosis DESCRIPTION: An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as demineralization/caries, hidden fractures, and formation of abscesses. The equipment adopts a piezoelectric and laser optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation of teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will be analyzed by a pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinics and contribute to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. The proposed concept has been successfully demonstrated in the previous Phase I study. In this Phase II study, instrumentation for clinical data collection using a combination of conventional piezoelectric and new laser-based ultrasonic technologies will be developed and optimized; an artificial intelligence based diagnostic function will be developed using clinical data and implemented using embedded computing; numerical simulations will be used to enhance diagnostic function development; and finally, initial clinical trials will be conducted to demonstrate the performance of the prototype equipment. The ultrasonic apparatus for Dental diagnosis outlined in this application is a first application of AI-based NDE in Dentistry.

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6740904,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biological signal transduction', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'electromyography', 'evaluation /testing', 'human subject', 'motor neurons', 'neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2004,626002,-0.007313305627968528
"A Laser-Based Device for Work Site Stability Assessment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A laser-based acoustic emission (AE) detection device is proposed (Phase I & II) for work site structural stability assessment in order to reduce the occupational injuries and fatalities caused by roof falls, sidewall crumples, stop collapses, slope slides, etc., in the mining industry. This applied research and development addresses the miner's safety and contributes to ensuring the mineworker's right to ""safe and healthful working conditions"" (Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970). This new device will take advantage of innovations in laser ultrasonic, artificial intelligence (AI) and conventional acoustic emission technology to provide mine workers with a unique instant, real time stability assessment of immediate rock structures in the working environment, which was not attainable in the past. This research will also result in a unique non-contact monitoring device for acoustic emission/microseismic studies, which will be very useful in many areas of application. The primary objective of the Phase I research is to demonstrate under laboratory conditions the concept of the laser device for stability assessment, and to construct a prototype setup for further development and optimization in the subsequent Phase II research. This primary objective consists of five specific aims: 1. Specimen preparation, 2. Development of laser-based AE monitor, 3.

"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,-0.01279532442410478
"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.      The Phase II work plan has three tracks: 1) Computer vision software development and testing, 2) Human interface design and development, and 3) development and testing of the two forms of the device.

The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.

"AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at advancing the state of the art in chemistry education software in a critically important respect demanded by students, teachers, administrators and Quantum Simulations, Inc. customers. The focus of this innovation is the development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry problem solving. Empowerment of students to make the proper decisions about drugs through experiencing the scientific process requires a solid education in basic chemistry. Chemical formulas comprise much of the fundamental ""language"" of chemistry in which students must be fluent in order to succeed. The topic of writing and understanding chemical formulas, a cornerstone of all general chemistry classes, is a reasonable starting point for the development of an AI assessment system for student learning in chemistry. A solid understanding of chemical formulas is a prerequisite to success in chemistry required not only for literacy to make informed decisions about drugs from a scientific standpoint, but also to enable and prepare students to pursue careers in research related to drug abuse. Quantum has already successfully developed and commercialized an ITS for writing chemical formulas which will be used as the starting point for the present work. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies. A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into two long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. Quantum intends to employ an identical business model to commercialize the results of this project. n/a",AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse,6831228,R43DA018455,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug abuse education', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'science education']",NIDA,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2004,61750,-0.03181963262823562
"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6821032,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2004,153968,-0.043343472584586006
"Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, myocardial ischemia is the underlying etiology in nearly 70% of the 5 million patients suffering from mechanical failure of the cardiac left ventricle (LV). Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.

"Physiological Controller for Rotary Blood Pumps DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    As the prospects of chronic mechanical assistance for the failing human heart are fast becoming a reality, and patients are indeed returning home to regain a normal lifestyle, the limitations of this technology upon quality of life are becoming more apparent. To address many of these limitations, investigators are developing next-generation ventricular assist devices. Based on turbopump technology, these new devices offer smaller size, greater efficiency (hence smaller batteries), high reliability, and are more cost effective as compared to their pulsatile predecessors. For all the virtues of these new turbopumps, they bring additional challenges. Arguably the most urgent is the need for added ""intelligence."" These relatively ignorant devices are highly dependent on feedback-control to provide normal physiological response. The goal of the Phase- II effort proposed herein is to design a robust controller that may be incorporated into these turbodynamic pump systems for clinical use. The primary end product of this program would be a validated algorithm, in the form of firmware that will be embedded into existing rotary pump controller -- capable of maintaining optimal perfusion of the patient under a variety of hemodynamic demands and disturbances, while avoiding deleterious conditions such as ventricular suction. n/a",Physiological Controller for Rotary Blood Pumps,6803953,R44HL066656,"['artificial intelligence', 'auxiliary heart prosthesis', 'biomedical device power system', 'biomedical equipment development', 'cardiac output', 'circulatory assist', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cow', 'electrophysiology', 'hemolysis', 'mathematical model', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'sheep']",NHLBI,"LAUNCHPOINT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2004,374766,0.009858862889363513
"Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant)  The overall goal of the proposal is to improve ambulatory and long-term EEG monitoring using an innovative wireless EEG system. The specific aim of this proposal is to develop an ambulatory wireless EEG monitoring system with real-time adaptive and re-configuration capabilities, which will allow more clinical data to be transmitted in the same bandwidth and in a small portable package. The proposed device will adapt its data acquisition hardware to the underlying clinical event permitting it to focus its high transmission rates to periods of clinically relevant events. The events will be detected by our powerful seizure monitor algorithm which will have direct control over a flexible and innovative hardware. The result is enhanced wireless EEG in a small package, low power and with data quality comparable to bulkier clinical tethered system. The ability to optimize bandwidth is timely due to new FDA telemetry guidelines, which restricts the availability of frequencies and bandwidths in medical devices. Another advantage to optimizing output is that more meaningful data can be created without excessively large data files, which will speed analysis and review. Finally, the proposed device will be able to dynamically reconfigure itself in real time to compensate for serious data-corrupting events such as when one or several electrodes become loose or detached. In summary, the two major innovations are: 1- Real-time adaptive capability for adjusting the quantity and quality of the acquired and transmitted EEG data to better reflect the underlying clinical event (such as a seizure), 2- more practical and accurate ambulatory monitoring by the real-time automatic reconfiguration of the EEG acquisition system.       In Phase I, we designed, fabricated and tested a prototype system. Bench top and clinical testing showed that the system can indeed modify its output in response to artifacts or changes in EEG morphology. In Phase II, we will complete development including a radio design that meets the new FDA guidelines, and test on long-term patients with epilepsy.               n/a",Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG,6888368,R44NS042999,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electrodes', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemedicine', 'telemetry']",NINDS,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R44,2004,416347,0.004888805856687452
"Wireless EEG/PSG System with Novel Artifact Removal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): EEG is a valuable non-invasive clinical tool in numerous applications, from the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases to the clinical monitoring of neurological injuries, sleep disorders and depth of anesthesia.  However, EEG signals are very susceptible to various artifacts which seriously impede the EEG interpretation and compromise its therapeutic capabilities. Methods currently employed for removing artifacts from EEG recordings are not clinically effective or feasible for real-time and long-term neuro-monitoring. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to develop a novel, high-fidelity artifact identification and removal technique that will be specifically useful for ambulatory EEG recording and intervention.      The proposed novel artifact removal technique is based on the Wavelet-Based Artifact Removal (WBAR) method, which exploits the excellent time-frequency localization of artifacts provided by the wavelet decomposition. The WBAR method is computationally very efficient and allows for simultaneous, real-time removal of a variety of EEG artifacts. It has been recently developed by the PI and tested for a single EEG channel in an extensive clinical study as part of a novel depth-of-anesthesia monitor.       The WBAR method will be improved by combining it with the Wavelet Neural Networks for the precise artifact classification, and recursive EEG Parameterization methods for the reliable estimation of the corrupted EEG components. The combination of these methods will result in fully automated, real-timeartifact removal technique that maximally preserves valid EEG information.       The development and implementation of this novel method will greatly enhance the functionality and  utilization of Cleveland Medical Devices' entire line of ambulatory wireless EEG/PSG systems. n/a",Wireless EEG/PSG System with Novel Artifact Removal,6792393,R43NS046978,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'electroencephalography', 'human subject', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research', 'polysomnography', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'sleep']",NINDS,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R43,2004,204478,-0.02341269031858777
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6780874,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', 'age difference', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'newborn human (0-6 weeks)', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2004,194888,-0.020403485758511225

"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.

"A Run-to-Run Algorithm for Glucose Regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long term objective of this work is to develop new algorithmic approaches to optimize the delivery of insulin in an automated fashion to people with type 1 diabetes. Specifically, we aim to develop a strategy, inspired by run-to-run control theory established by the chemical process industries, that ""learns"" from the previous sequence of glucose responses to insulin dosing (over the course of days), and optimally predicts the appropriate strategy for the forthcoming day. The notion of a ""cycle"" in engineering will be extended to manage the 24 hour routine of repeated meals, activities, and sleep cycles and the corresponding dosing of insulin. The algorithm will be tested in both simulation and clinical trials for robustness to sensor noise, uncertainty in the patient characterization, variability in the timing of the postprandial glucose peak, and variability in the carbohydrate content in the meals. The Specific Aims of this project are to: i) construct predictive patient sensitivity models for calculation of optimal insulin dosing from elevated (or depressed) glucose levels, ii) develop run-to-run algorithm for insulin bolus dosing to provide corrections in subsequent days based on previous history of glucose levels and insulin dosage, and iii) evaluate the robustness of the algorithm through meal challenges of varying carbohydrate content. The aims will blend prototype algorithms that are drawn from systems engineering with validation in a series of clinical tests. The proposed collaboration between systems engineers and renowned diabetes researchers in an established clinical research setting will allow a novel fusion of methods that can be truly characterized as ""innovative"".

"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6792043,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2004,153537,-0.018985080592746117
"Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Biochemical signal transduction is a        critical basic cellular process by which information travels from the receptors      on the surface of a cell to the nucleus where responses to the signals are           generated. Originally thought to be a relatively simple system that merely           passed along signals, signal transduction has proven to be a highly complicated      system of molecules whose interactions have yet to be fully understood.              Furthermore, a number of disease states such as cancer, diabetes, and                neurological disorders have their origins in malfunctioning signal transduction      components. Until signal transduction is understood in its totality, rational        intervention of these diseases will be significantly hampered. While                 conventional laboratory methods have been used to study individual components        or pathways involved in signal transduction, they have less utility in studying      how signal transduction systems work as a whole and therefore do not detect          higher levels or organization and regulation that are known to exist in other        complex systems. In this application, it is proposed that signal transduction        systems be mathematically modeled and analyzed in order to determine the role        of complexity in the system. It is hypothesized that signal transduction             involves both the movement and processing of information in such a way as to         provide a cell the capacity for decision making, something every cell must           possess at some level. The most advanced techniques in the field of chaos            theory and neural networks (the basis of artificial intelligence) will be            applied to determine whether biochemical signal transduction systems have the        fundamental features of a complex system, how those features might be used for       cell level decision making, and how mutations in the system might affect the         higher level functions of the system. The elucidation of such higher levels of       function in signal transduction systems would greatly enhance our understanding      of this basic cellular function and make the rational design of therapy more         effective.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems,6745076,R01GM067272,"['biological information processing', 'biological signal transduction', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'mathematical model', 'mathematics', 'model design /development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA OMAHA,R01,2004,314225,-0.03529955725628426
"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase 1, we propose to:   Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population   Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms   Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations   Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product      using both statistical methods and subjective questionnaires.            n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,6792878,R41EY015023,"['age difference', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'gender difference', 'human subject', 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca', 'occupational health /safety', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'syndrome', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual photosensitivity', 'work site']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2004,100000,-0.04446094174832794
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Development of Ultrasonic Appratus for Dental Diagnosis DESCRIPTION: An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as demineralization/caries, hidden fractures, and formation of abscesses. The equipment adopts a piezoelectric and laser optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation of teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will be analyzed by a pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinics and contribute to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. The proposed concept has been successfully demonstrated in the previous Phase I study. In this Phase II study, instrumentation for clinical data collection using a combination of conventional piezoelectric and new laser-based ultrasonic technologies will be developed and optimized; an artificial intelligence based diagnostic function will be developed using clinical data and implemented using embedded computing; numerical simulations will be used to enhance diagnostic function development; and finally, initial clinical trials will be conducted to demonstrate the performance of the prototype equipment. The ultrasonic apparatus for Dental diagnosis outlined in this application is a first application of AI-based NDE in Dentistry.

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6642050,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2003,562596,-0.007313305627968528
"Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of motor function due to accidental injury, stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, together with disorders of mental health, are the most crippling human ailments. One common result of mechanical insult is spinal cord injury (SCI), in which damage of the spinal cord by contusion, compression or laceration causes loss of sensation, motor and reflex function below the point of injury. Other symptoms of SCI may include bowel and bladder dysfunction, hyperalgesia and sexual dysfunction. Although many SCI patients survive injury, major chronic dysfunction is the most common outcome. There are approximately 10,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S each year. In contrast to the relatively small acute patient population, chronic SCI, involving approximately 200,000-250,000 people in this country, is extremely expensive to society, both in terms of human and economic costs. Because most SCI victims are under age 30 at the time of their injury, and most now live a near-normal life span, direct medical costs average $2 million per patient over a lifetime, and approximately $5 billion total per year in the US only. Therefore, any   drug or intervention that can positively improve the quality of life of patients suffering from SCI is likely to have a greater financial impact than would be expected simply from the cost of acute injury each year.  Animal models for SCI and other conditions that affect gait and motor coordination are successfully used today to develop new treatments. Assessing the level of motor dysfunction in an animal model is a difficult challenge as most researchers rely on the subjective scoring of symptoms. We propose here to build a system that will allow a more objective, faster and consistent assessment of the level of injury and course of recovery in rat and mouse models of SCI that can be applied in the future to other gait and motor coordination disorders. An artificial intelligent system based on computer vision will be developed to capture and score gait and motor coordination in rodents and will be validated against the standard scores of motor function obtained using the methods of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (1995) for the rat model of SCI.         n/a",Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function,6695163,R43NS046980,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gait', ' laboratory rat', ' limb movement', ' psychomotor function', ' spinal cord injury']",NINDS,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2003,234554,-0.016035864134257855
"Development of a Multi-State Decoding Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to increase the capability and decrease the cost of decoding the Illumina bead array platform by adding decode states. DNA probes attached to microbeads are randomly loaded onto fiber optic bundles. A decoding process of sequential hybridization stages is necessary to determine the locus correspondence of each bead. Decoders (sequences complementary to the DNA probes on the beads) that are either unlabeled, or labeled with a dye are hybridized to the array. Images are taken after each hybridization, and the experiment is designed so that the hybridization signature of each bead through the decode process, uniquely determines the identity of the bead. The cost and time of decoding is proportional to the number of decode stages. The number of stages is determined by the number of loci represented on the array and the number of distinguishable labels, or decode states, used in the decode process (e.g. ON in dye 1). The current availability of 3 states allows the decoding of 1,500 probes in 8 stages. The successful execution of this project would extend the number of states to at least 8. With 8 states, the number of stages for the 1,500-probe product would become 4. The number of probes that could be decoded in 8 stages would increase by 3 orders of magnitude. The main components of the project are wet lab chemistry and algorithm development. Wet lab chemistry will be used to determine the optimal mixture of dye labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides that will lead to distinguishable intensity states. Beads will have signal levels in FAM and CY3 dye. Variability in the process will need to be sufficiently low to reliably distinguish different concentrations of dye labeled oligonucleo tides. Three levels of FAM and CY3 signal would lead to 9 states. It is likely that 8 of these will be reliably distinguishable. Pattern matching algorithms will be developed to decode the beads. Decision tree methods based on expected signal will be applied. Arrays will be decoded twice -- first with the current 3-state decoding, and then with the multi-state decoding -- to enable training and machine learning algorithms. Achieving 8 state decoding will decrease the cost of the array and dramatically increase the number of loci explored and the number of probes per locus. n/a",Development of a Multi-State Decoding Framework,6737095,R43HG003096,"['chemistry', ' cost effectiveness', ' dyes', ' mathematics', ' microarray technology', ' nucleic acid probes', ' technology /technique development']",NHGRI,"ILLUMINA, INC.",R43,2003,141830,-0.00783393939557456
"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.

"Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While density-functional calculations of the energy are now feasible for biomolecules, the use of density-functional geometry optimizers is still confined to relatively small molecules containing no more than thirty atoms. The key limitation of conventional density-functional geometry optimizers is that the cost of the geometry optimization scales at least quadratically with the number of atoms in the molecule. In contrast the energy at a fixed geometry can be evaluated for a cost which scales linearly with molecule size, enabling very large molecules to be treated. This proposal is based on a radical change in the algorithm for density-functional geometry optimization, potentially reducing the total cost from quadratic to linear in molecule size and enabling a quantum leap in the size of molecules that can be optimized. The proposed algorithm resembles a conventional self-consistent calculation of the energy at a fixed geometry but at convergence the proposed algorithm yields not only the density but also the optimized geometry. This is achieved by simultaneous optimization of the wavefunction and the geometry via a modified self-consistent-field procedure. The proposed algorithm will be implemented in the QChem software package and, if successful, widely distributed through QChem Inc. and Spartan Inc.           n/a",Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules,6583907,R43GM067335,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical models', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' mathematics', ' molecular dynamics', ' molecular size', ' quantum chemistry']",NIGMS,"Q-CHEM, INC.",R43,2003,99639,-0.015751689173032164
"Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of an RCT are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. The most frequently used hypothesis tests assume a population model for statistical inference, even though a randomization model is more consistent with real-world characteristics of RCTs. Approximate p- values returned by population-model tests can, under certain circumstances, be misleading, resulting in effective drugs being declared ineffective, or ineffective drugs being declared effective. To support analysis of RCTs using the appropriate randomization model, sophisticated software for conducting randomization-based permutation tests is needed. Ongoing advances in computing technology have created a favorable climate for widespread use of such software. The goal of this research is to develop flexible and robust software for carrying out randomization-based permutation tests for single- or multi- clinic RCTs. A subset of this functionality has been successfully implemented in a Phase I pre-prototype (""RTAnalyzer""). Phase II seeks to build a full-scale prototype capable of handling a wide variety of trial designs, including designs using adaptive randomization. The Phase II project includes collaborations with two experts in the field of permutation testing: Dr. William Rosenberger and Dr. Bonnie LaFleur. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Software that can use general permutation tests to analyze clinical trial data would have clear commercial value to clinical research organizations in academia, Government, and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Key applications are the analysis of clinical trials with unusual randomization schemes, trials with unusual patterns of treatment response, and trials where standard distributional assumptions are invalid. n/a",Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials,6622262,R44CA086556,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,"LINCOLN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2003,373280,-0.009273412750547652
"Vector Quantization for Image Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This Phase-I SBIR application addresses the increasingly significant challenges faced by pathologists and clinicians in manually inspecting microscope slides. Microscopic inspection suffers from being labor-intensive, subjective, expensive and limited by the need for physical access to the glass slide specimen of interest. The obstacle to automated microscopic inspection has been the inability to efficiently digitize entire microscope specimens at high resolutions. Aperio has developed the ScanScope (R), a novel microscope slide scanner that makes it practical - for the first time - to rapidly create virtual microscope slides at high resolutions. Virtual slides set the stage for automating microscopic inspection using automated pattern recognition. This research aims to adapt and optimize Aperio's existing and novel algorithms for vector quantization (VQ) to the problem of automatic pattern recognition in virtual slides. VQ is a general mathematical technique for encoding bitstreams using a vocabulary. The primary aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of using VQ for pattern recognition in a practical and well-characterized application: automatically finding virtually all micrometastasis clusters in cytology specimens.

"Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, myocardial ischemia is the underlying etiology in nearly 70% of the 5 million patients suffering from mechanical failure of the cardiac left ventricle (LV). Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.      Specific Aims (R33 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop a neural network MPCE system and test it initially in animals (Year 3).   Aim 2 - Refine parametric mapping and test reproducibility of MPCE data in humans (Year 4).   Successful completion of this project will result in noninvasive, quantitative, objective, and reproducible interpretation of LV function, thus facilitating optimal diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in cardiology. n/a",Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography,6688878,R21HL070363,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' echocardiography', ' evaluation /testing', ' heart function', ' human subject', ' method development', ' swine']",NHLBI,"MAYO CLINIC COLL OF MEDICINE, ROCHESTER",R21,2003,136861,-0.017877415602775486
"System for Cost Effective Clinical Trial Design The long-term objective of this project is to develop software to facilitate the design of cost effective clinical trials. In 1999, the pharmaceutical industry and NIH spent more than $23 billion on clinical trials. Developments in clinical trial design theory, and in optimization algorithms have opened possibilities for more cost- effective designs that can be executed for lower total cost, over shorter periods of time and / or requiring fewer patients. The proposed System for Cost Effective Trials (SCET) will be a software package to guide the trial designer through comparisons of the power, sample size requirements, and cost of alternate trial designs. These methods are under-used throughout medical research, but are particularly applicable to trials with relatively short treatment regimens and rapid ascertainment of endpoints, such as many cancer treatment trials. The aims of SCET Phase II are to build the system, validate it in compliance with FDA regulations for software validation, perform Beta testing at a range of target client organizations, and use the Beta test findings to produce a marketable release.

"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites.

"Physiological Controller for Rotary Blood Pumps DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    As the prospects of chronic mechanical assistance for the failing human heart are fast becoming a reality, and patients are indeed returning home to regain a normal lifestyle, the limitations of this technology upon quality of life are becoming more apparent. To address many of these limitations, investigators are developing next-generation ventricular assist devices. Based on turbopump technology, these new devices offer smaller size, greater efficiency (hence smaller batteries), high reliability, and are more cost effective as compared to their pulsatile predecessors. For all the virtues of these new turbopumps, they bring additional challenges. Arguably the most urgent is the need for added ""intelligence."" These relatively ignorant devices are highly dependent on feedback-control to provide normal physiological response.

"Smart Power Assistance Module for Manual Wheelchairs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use power assistance as the basis for a Smart Power Assistance Module (SPAM) that provides independent power assistance to the right and left rear wheels of a manual wheelchair. The SPAM will detect obstacles near the wheelchair, and modify the forces applied to each wheel to avoid obstacles.  For individuals with visual impairments that are unable to walk with a long cane or walker, the SPAM will provide safe travel by assisting the user to avoid obstacles. This research will build on the investigative team's previous experience with power assistance for manual wheelchairs and obstacle avoidance for power wheelchairs and rollators. Extensive outside evaluation of the SPAM will be provided throughout the course of the project by clinicians active in wheelchair seating and mobility.         n/a",Smart Power Assistance Module for Manual Wheelchairs,6667132,R43EY014490,"['artificial intelligence', ' assistive device /technology', ' biomedical device power system', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' field study', ' human subject', ' medical rehabilitation related tag', ' vision aid', ' vision disorders']",NEI,AT SCIENCES,R43,2003,209800,-0.020234421762176585
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6642804,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2003,193637,-0.020403485758511225
"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6633609,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2003,618638,-0.009203244524330112

"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.  Commercial applications include marketing to healthcare  providers, namely managed care organizations, and employers who share the burden of  healthcare expenses.  n/a",Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management,6651486,R44HL070549,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior therapy', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dietary lipid', ' health education', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' interactive multimedia', ' nutrient intake activity', ' patient oriented research', ' weight control', ' weight loss']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2003,479254,-0.049543602400568584
"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample. The design is       a 4-group (Control, Modular Expert System intervention, Telecommunications           Intervention, Integrated Expert System Intervention) x 3 occasions (0, 12, and       24 months). Each behavioral risk factor will be intervened upon for 12 months        and the 3 risk factors will be related simultaneously. The 3 interventions           evaluated in this project have the potential to be easily disseminated at low        costs to entire populations of at-risk individuals.                                                                                                                       n/a",Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks,6646548,R01CA085807,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer prevention', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer human interaction', ' cost effectiveness', ' dietary lipid', ' education evaluation /planning', ' exercise', ' human subject', ' lifestyle', ' neoplasm /cancer education', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition education', ' nutrition related tag', ' saturated fat', ' smoking', ' smoking cessation', ' tobacco abuse', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,R01,2003,771418,-0.02272900869611284
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6688775,R21NS045410,"[""Parkinson's disease"", ' abnormal involuntary movement', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' electromyography', ' human subject', ' method development', ' neuromuscular disorder', ' psychomotor function', ' tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2003,178485,-0.018985080592746117
"Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Biochemical signal transduction is a        critical basic cellular process by which information travels from the receptors      on the surface of a cell to the nucleus where responses to the signals are           generated. Originally thought to be a relatively simple system that merely           passed along signals, signal transduction has proven to be a highly complicated      system of molecules whose interactions have yet to be fully understood.              Furthermore, a number of disease states such as cancer, diabetes, and                neurological disorders have their origins in malfunctioning signal transduction      components. Until signal transduction is understood in its totality, rational        intervention of these diseases will be significantly hampered. While                 conventional laboratory methods have been used to study individual components        or pathways involved in signal transduction, they have less utility in studying      how signal transduction systems work as a whole and therefore do not detect          higher levels or organization and regulation that are known to exist in other        complex systems. In this application, it is proposed that signal transduction        systems be mathematically modeled and analyzed in order to determine the role        of complexity in the system. It is hypothesized that signal transduction             involves both the movement and processing of information in such a way as to         provide a cell the capacity for decision making, something every cell must           possess at some level. The most advanced techniques in the field of chaos            theory and neural networks (the basis of artificial intelligence) will be            applied to determine whether biochemical signal transduction systems have the        fundamental features of a complex system, how those features might be used for       cell level decision making, and how mutations in the system might affect the         higher level functions of the system.

"Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year old without any apparent warning signs.  It is the leading cause of death of infants between the age of one month and one year in the developed countries. Previous studies have indicated that SIDS victims may suffer from cardiorespiratory failure, which reflects immaturity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Heart variability (HRV) has been shown to be a noninvasive and inexpensive way to assess the ANS. Increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability have been observed in SIDS victims. While it is unclear whether there is a relationship between SIDS and infants who have apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) like apnea and bradycardia, there is a desire to gain a better understanding of the nature of ALTE, their frequency and severity, and the ability of home monitors to detect events and provide an alarm. The Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study group, formed by NIH, sought to study these issues through the collection of a massive clinical database, which includes physiological, signals from 529 infants recorded in polysomnographic (PSG) studies. The infants were then studied several months using a home monitor which recorded life-threatening events. A classification is available regarding which infants had verified, apparent life-threatening events. Given the wealth of information linking SIDS and heart rate variability (HRV), we desire to investigate whether heart rate variability is effective predictor for life-threatening events. This research will investigate whether HRV can differentiate infants at risk for future apparent life-threatening events (FALTE). First statistical methods will be used to determine if there is significant difference in HRV between normal and FALTE infant groups. Next, the major goal is to design a method to classify infants using HRV, exploring various prediction models including logistic regression, decision tree, and neural networks. The relationship between HRV parameters and all the affected factors will also be studied to provide a clearer understanding of the parameters, and to help determine how to use HRV as a classifier. Successful prediction of infants with future apparent life-threatening events could have clinical significance and provide physicians with an opportunity for treatment.   n/a",Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data,6619652,R03HD042479,"['apnea', ' autonomic nervous system', ' bradycardia', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' infant human (0-1 year)', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient monitoring device', ' polysomnography', ' statistics /biometry', ' sudden infant death syndrome']",NICHD,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,78500,-0.037012475912679865
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6536089,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2002,622485,-0.007313305627968528
"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6522796,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer human interaction', ' videotape /videodisc', ' workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2002,5000,-0.008293936645070932

"Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of an RCT are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. The most frequently used hypothesis tests assume a population model for statistical inference, even though a randomization model is more consistent with real-world characteristics of RCTs. Approximate p- values returned by population-model tests can, under certain circumstances, be misleading, resulting in effective drugs being declared ineffective, or ineffective drugs being declared effective. To support analysis of RCTs using the appropriate randomization model, sophisticated software for conducting randomization-based permutation tests is needed. Ongoing advances in computing technology have created a favorable climate for widespread use of such software. The goal of this research is to develop flexible and robust software for carrying out randomization-based permutation tests for single- or multi- clinic RCTs. A subset of this functionality has been successfully implemented in a Phase I pre-prototype (""RTAnalyzer""). Phase II seeks to build a full-scale prototype capable of handling a wide variety of trial designs, including designs using adaptive randomization. The Phase II project includes collaborations with two experts in the field of permutation testing: Dr. William Rosenberger and Dr. Bonnie LaFleur. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Software that can use general permutation tests to analyze clinical trial data would have clear commercial value to clinical research organizations in academia, Government, and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Key applications are the analysis of clinical trials with unusual randomization schemes, trials with unusual patterns of treatment response, and trials where standard distributional assumptions are invalid. n/a",Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials,6444337,R44CA086556,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,"LINCOLN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2002,362409,-0.009273412750547652
"Long Term Glucose Sensing & Physiologic Insulin Delivery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 4 million individuals with Type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin in the U.S. individual with diabetes are constantly challenged to measure their blood glucose and administer the appropriate insulin dose to achieve tight glucose control. Tight glucose control, achievable with intensive insulin therapy, dramatically reduces secondary complication of diabetes, but requires frequent painful blood samples and increases the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, individuals with the disease have long awaited an automatic closed-loop system that would control their glucose without the need for constant intervention. In the present proposal, two closed-loop systems to achieve this goal are developed. Both systems use a long-term fully implantable glucose sensor. One of the systems links the sensor to a fully implantable intraperitoneal insulin pump; the second links the sensor to an external insulin delivery pump. It is anticipated that some patients may require the implantable pump and that others will want to have the option of which pump to use. The systems have a common goal - to emulate, as closely as possible; glucose control achieved in a healthy individual. To achieve this goal, a physiology-insulin-delivery algorithm is proposed that emulates B-cell responses to glucose observed in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. The B-cell response is optimally adjusted to overcome delays associated with intraperitoneal (fully implanted pump) or subcutaneous (external pump) insulin delivery. Digital filters are developed to optimally remove noise in the sensor signal. A method of tuning the system, consistent with the level of glucose tolerance achieved by the B-cell is developed. Performance and safety of each system is evaluated. If successful, the systems can be expected to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes by dramatically reducing the burden placed on individuals with type 1 diabetes, and by reducing the costs of treating hypoglycemia and secondary complications.         n/a",Long Term Glucose Sensing & Physiologic Insulin Delivery,6588873,R01DK064567,"['artificial endocrine pancreas', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' biosensor device', ' clinical research', ' dogs', ' human subject', ' implant', ' insulin', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' pancreatic islets']",NIDDK,MEDTRONIC MINIMED,R01,2002,664917,-0.01823777754868621
"Narrow-Band Active Noise Reduction for DPOAE Measurement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to enable accurate acquisition of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements in relatively high noise environments for use in hearing evaluations and screening. DPOAE measurements have been shown to be an effective and efficient method for screening infant, children, and adult hearing. Environmental noise, however, has been shown to adversely affect the ability to successfully obtain DPOAE measurements, especially at frequencies below 1500 Hz.  We will achieve our aim by developing a narrow-band, adaptive active noise reduction system that will seamlessly augment existing DPOAE measurement protocols. Our innovation will supplement existing DPOAE measurement systems with both low-cost acoustic hardware and advanced signal processing techniques. By reducing background noise levels in a narrow frequency band near the DPOAE test frequencies, we will enable higher signal-to-noise ratio DPOAE measurement sequences. The increased SNR will result in the ability to obtain DPOAE measurements in relatively high noise environments such as the newborn intensive care unit and nursery, offices of pediatricians, schools without special audiology facilities, field hospitals, and remote or mobile clinics. n/a",Narrow-Band Active Noise Reduction for DPOAE Measurement,6485483,R43DC005112,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' hearing tests', ' human subject', ' measurement', ' noise', ' otoacoustic emission', ' sound frequency']",NIDCD,"CREARE, INC.",R43,2002,103954,-0.03992395829771961
"Self and Consciousness: Roots of Humanity?   DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): This is a proposal for a two-day             symposium and associated book entitled, ""Self and Consciousness: Roots of             Humanity?"" The purpose of the conference is to elucidate the many ways in which      self and consciousness interrelate. This will lead to substantial increases in       the understanding of both self and identity (by identifying the ways in which        personal and social self-definition depend on consciousness, and under what          conditions, and with what effects, consciousness gives rise to                       self-consciousness) and consciousness (by specifying the diverse ways in which       self and identity are implicated in the many facets of consciousness). The           concepts of self/identity and consciousness each have recently come to the fore      in the social and behavioral sciences. However, the ways in which these              multidimensional constructs are connected has received limited attention.            Further, existing work on self and consciousness is piecemeal and fragmented,        spread across a wide range of topics and studied by scholars from diverse            disciplines. The symposium will identify, organize, and prioritize a set of          theoretical questions, investigative approaches, and empirical findings              pertaining to the role of self and identity as antecedents, accompaniments, and      consequences of consciousness. In doing so, the conference/book will set an          agenda for future research in this area and point toward prevention and              treatment strategies for mental illnesses involving disturbances of self and/or      consciousness. The symposium will be structured as follows: (1) Where we came        from - Self and consciousness in ""prehuman"" species (are humans really               unique?) and through human history (is there something special about modern          self and consciousness?); (2) Where we are now: Humans as biological beasts and      cognitive creatures - The brain and mind as biological and cognitive systems         underlying self and consciousness; (3) Where we are now: Humans as social            beings-The social underpinnings of self and consciousness, including how self        and consciousness emerge in face-to-face interactions over the course of             development and how societal belief systems impact (and often disturb) the self      and consciousness of individuals; (4) Where we might go - Where humans will          likely go in the future, including how human selves and consciousness might be       changed by interacting with computers and related electronic media and the           possibility of the construction of ""conscious computers with selves."" Each           topic will be addressed by two speakers followed by a discussant. An edited          volume based on the conference will be published by Oxford University Press.         This book will not be a simple proceedings collection. The editor and an             independent referee will read each paper. The editor will synthesize the             critiques and send them to each author, who will then revise his/her contribution.  In addition, the associated published book will have an introductory chapter that  describes the volume's themes and organization, and a concluding chapter that  summarizes the chapters and highlights emergent issues. n/a",Self and Consciousness: Roots of Humanity?,6416745,R13MH064642,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' books', ' cognition', ' computer human interaction', ' consciousness', ' evolution', ' identity', ' interpersonal relations', ' meeting /conference /symposium', ' psychological identification', ' social psychology', ' travel']",NIMH,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R13,2002,24550,-0.04197087942836854
"System for Cost Effective Clinical Trial Design The long-term objective of this project is to develop software to facilitate the design of cost effective clinical trials. In 1999, the pharmaceutical industry and NIH spent more than $23 billion on clinical trials. Developments in clinical trial design theory, and in optimization algorithms have opened possibilities for more cost- effective designs that can be executed for lower total cost, over shorter periods of time and / or requiring fewer patients. The proposed System for Cost Effective Trials (SCET) will be a software package to guide the trial designer through comparisons of the power, sample size requirements, and cost of alternate trial designs. These methods are under-used throughout medical research, but are particularly applicable to trials with relatively short treatment regimens and rapid ascertainment of endpoints, such as many cancer treatment trials. The aims of SCET Phase II are to build the system, validate it in compliance with FDA regulations for software validation, perform Beta testing at a range of target client organizations, and use the Beta test findings to produce a marketable release. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The potential market for this software system includes virtually every pharmaceutical company in the world (multiple licenses to each), every biotech company involved in clinical trials, every contract research organization involved in the design or conduct of clinical trials, coordinating centers of NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials, individual university-based investigators who conduct clinical trials, individual biostatistical consultants who design clinical trials, and agricultural businesses and researchers that conduct animal research. n/a",System for Cost Effective Clinical Trial Design,6485420,R44CA088667,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cost effectiveness', ' drug design /synthesis /production', ' experimental designs']",NCI,"RHO FEDERAL SYSTEMS DIVISION, INC.",R44,2002,380192,-0.0039208767978216015
"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites. It will provide routine, automated, continuous, and real-time monitoring capabilities for patients undergoing IV therapy.   n/a",Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration,6550261,R44HL062008,"['artificial intelligence', ' blood coagulation', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fiber optics', ' human subject', ' intravenous administration', ' medical complication', ' necrosis', ' optics', ' patient monitoring device', ' swine', ' technology /technique development']",NHLBI,"CW OPTICS, INC.",R44,2002,250708,-0.03387835288385073
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6538226,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2002,66954,-0.021887286614725165
"COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION There are approximately 2.5 million people in the US who are speech impaired to the extent that it is considered a functional limitation.  Today, many people with severe communication disabilities lack access to electronic and even printed material, have a lack of opportunity for interaction and opportunity for self-advocacy, and experience isolation.  Providing accessibility to wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device is of tremendous importance to people with severe communication disabilities. The primary objective under the Phase I grant was to investigate the potential of word-level disambiguation technology for text generation on a communication aid to meet the needs of many individuals requiring augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).  Phase I findings validated T9 technology as a viable method for text generation and also AAC device users want to access wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device.  The specific aims of Phase II are to: investigate hardware platforms for AAC device host candidates, develop Windows software modules for T9 and AAC, develop portable AAC resources, integrate wireless voice and data communications, and conduct usability testing of the product as it develops. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION The outcome of Phase II will be a communication aid device for production in Phase III that is based on commercially available hardware with minimal custom AAC hardware support.  The goal is that the software platform developed in Phase II will be ported to existing low-cost hardware as much as possible to: make use of newly developed platforms, provide more choice to AAC device users, provide more flexibility in user interface, and reduce overall device costs to the end user when commercially manufactured.  n/a",COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION,6569890,R44RR013191,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' clinical research', ' communication disorder aid', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' computer system hardware', ' human subject', ' online computer', ' vocabulary', ' voice']",NCRR,"MADENTEC (USA), INC.",R44,2002,139082,-0.0004813470973759278
"Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The behavioral components of electrographic seizures in rodents, primarily rats and mice, are generally used as the most fundamental basis for the presence of epileptic seizures. Numerous research grants use analysis of animal seizures as a fundamental component of the research, even research aimed at molecular and cellular mechanisms. The abnormal behaviors during a motor seizure are generally distinctive, but a certain degree of subjectivity is present from one laboratory to another. With the development of sophisticated electrodes for multiple recordings and the availability of radiotelemetry systems, the potential to combine automated studies of seizure behavior and electrographic seizure activity is now possible. We propose to develop and validate behavioral algorithms for identifying, classifying and quantifying the motor components of different types of seizures in mice and rats using digital video technology. We will define the behavioral components of different classes of seizures, and to do this in conjunction with electrographic seizures from EEG recordings. These behaviors will include but not be limited to unilateral and bilateral forelimb clonus and the assumption of a lordotic posture, with a characteristic positioning of the tail. A system that allows combined analysis of EEG and behavior will be fully developed to meet the demand from research laboratories at universities and pharmaceutical companies.   n/a",Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats,6549823,R43DA015571,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' body movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' drug addiction', ' electron optics', ' ethology', ' laboratory rat', ' nicotine', ' posture', ' psychometrics', ' self medication', ' video recording system', ' videotape /videodisc']",NIDA,"CLEVER SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2002,113671,-0.045634712305366365
"A Personal Status Monitor for the Home The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment.

"Smart Power Assistance Module for Manual Wheelchairs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use power assistance as the basis for a Smart Power Assistance Module (SPAM) that provides independent power assistance to the right and left rear wheels of a manual wheelchair. The SPAM will detect obstacles near the wheelchair, and modify the forces applied to each wheel to avoid obstacles.  For individuals with visual impairments that are unable to walk with a long cane or walker, the SPAM will provide safe travel by assisting the user to avoid obstacles. This research will build on the investigative team's previous experience with power assistance for manual wheelchairs and obstacle avoidance for power wheelchairs and rollators.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6529026,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2002,193637,-0.020403485758511225
"Digital Elevation Models for Population Estimates Research exploring the feasibility of deriving population estimates from remotely sensed data demonstrates that objects in the urban landscape can be identified and incorporated into a population estimates system based on the housing unit method. Nonetheless, this research also reveals shortcomings in the technology producing the input files used in the automatic detection of objects. The problem involves the assumption and techniques used when converting high resolution images into digital elevation models (DEM). DEM files serve as input to the programs used in the detection of housing units. Efforts to correctly identify housing units are time-consuming and error-prone without clear and distinct DEMs. The objectives of this Phase I SBIR application are to further refine strengthen and test the software employed in transforming satellite and aerial imagery into digital elevation model (DEMs).

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6514339,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2002,582434,-0.009203244524330112
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample. The design is       a 4-group (Control, Modular Expert System intervention, Telecommunications           Intervention, Integrated Expert System Intervention) x 3 occasions (0, 12, and       24 months). Each behavioral risk factor will be intervened upon for 12 months        and the 3 risk factors will be related simultaneously.

"Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Biochemical signal transduction is a        critical basic cellular process by which information travels from the receptors      on the surface of a cell to the nucleus where responses to the signals are           generated. Originally thought to be a relatively simple system that merely           passed along signals, signal transduction has proven to be a highly complicated      system of molecules whose interactions have yet to be fully understood.              Furthermore, a number of disease states such as cancer, diabetes, and                neurological disorders have their origins in malfunctioning signal transduction      components. Until signal transduction is understood in its totality, rational        intervention of these diseases will be significantly hampered. While                 conventional laboratory methods have been used to study individual components        or pathways involved in signal transduction, they have less utility in studying      how signal transduction systems work as a whole and therefore do not detect          higher levels or organization and regulation that are known to exist in other        complex systems. In this application, it is proposed that signal transduction        systems be mathematically modeled and analyzed in order to determine the role        of complexity in the system. It is hypothesized that signal transduction             involves both the movement and processing of information in such a way as to         provide a cell the capacity for decision making, something every cell must           possess at some level. The most advanced techniques in the field of chaos            theory and neural networks (the basis of artificial intelligence) will be            applied to determine whether biochemical signal transduction systems have the        fundamental features of a complex system, how those features might be used for       cell level decision making, and how mutations in the system might affect the         higher level functions of the system. The elucidation of such higher levels of       function in signal transduction systems would greatly enhance our understanding      of this basic cellular function and make the rational design of therapy more         effective.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems,6583980,R01GM067272,"['biological information processing', ' biological signal transduction', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' mathematics', ' model design /development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA OMAHA,R01,2002,209000,-0.03529955725628426
"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system.

"Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year old without any apparent warning signs.  It is the leading cause of death of infants between the age of one month and one year in the developed countries. Previous studies have indicated that SIDS victims may suffer from cardiorespiratory failure, which reflects immaturity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Heart variability (HRV) has been shown to be a noninvasive and inexpensive way to assess the ANS. Increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability have been observed in SIDS victims. While it is unclear whether there is a relationship between SIDS and infants who have apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) like apnea and bradycardia, there is a desire to gain a better understanding of the nature of ALTE, their frequency and severity, and the ability of home monitors to detect events and provide an alarm. The Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study group, formed by NIH, sought to study these issues through the collection of a massive clinical database, which includes physiological, signals from 529 infants recorded in polysomnographic (PSG) studies. The infants were then studied several months using a home monitor which recorded life-threatening events. A classification is available regarding which infants had verified, apparent life-threatening events. Given the wealth of information linking SIDS and heart rate variability (HRV), we desire to investigate whether heart rate variability is effective predictor for life-threatening events. This research will investigate whether HRV can differentiate infants at risk for future apparent life-threatening events (FALTE). First statistical methods will be used to determine if there is significant difference in HRV between normal and FALTE infant groups. Next, the major goal is to design a method to classify infants using HRV, exploring various prediction models including logistic regression, decision tree, and neural networks. The relationship between HRV parameters and all the affected factors will also be studied to provide a clearer understanding of the parameters, and to help determine how to use HRV as a classifier. Successful prediction of infants with future apparent life-threatening events could have clinical significance and provide physicians with an opportunity for treatment.   n/a",Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data,6607543,R03HD042479,"['apnea', ' autonomic nervous system', ' bradycardia', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' infant human (0-1 year)', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient monitoring device', ' polysomnography', ' statistics /biometry', ' sudden infant death syndrome']",NICHD,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R03,2002,78500,-0.037012475912679865

"Development of Ultrasonic Apparatus for Dental Diagnosis   DESCRIPTION: Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed (Phases 1 and 2)      for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as                     demineralization, caries, fractures, abscesses, and tooth wear. The equipment        adopts piezoelectric and optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation on       teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will then be analyzed by a        pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the         diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to      reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinic and also contribute       to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. In the Phase 1 research, tooth           specimens will be collected from local Dental clinics; demonstration                 instrumentation will be constructed; ultrasonic testing will be conducted on         the tooth specimens in vitro; and finally, the test data will be analyzed to         show the potential for Dental pathology identification.

The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6388212,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2001,604881,-0.007313305627968528
"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6421360,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer human interaction', ' videotape /videodisc', ' workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2001,5000,-0.008293936645070932

"PHYSIOLOGICAL CONTROLLER FOR ROTARY BLOOD PUMPS   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim From Applicant's Abstract): As the prospects of a              mechanical replacement for a failing human heart are fast becoming a reality,        and patients are indeed returning home to regain a ""normal"" lifestyle, the           limitations of this technology upon quality of life are becoming more apparent.      To address many of these limitations, investigators are developing                   next-generation ventricular assist devices. Based on turbopump technology,           these new devices offer smaller size, greater efficiency (hence smaller              batteries), high reliability, and are more cost effective as compared to their       pulsatile predecessessors. For all the virtues of these new turbopumps, they         bring with additional challenges. Arguably the most urgent is the need for           added intelligence."" These, relatively stupid, devices are highly dependent on       feedback-control to provide physiological response. Unfortunately, developers        have yet to wage a systematic assault on this problem. Preoccupied with              apparently more urgent issues, such as biocompatibility etc., there has been         relatively little attention or resources directed at developing a physiological      controller.                                                                                                                                                               For the past eight years, the P.I. has had an interest in this problem, and has      conducted basic and applied research towards developing control algorithms. He       now proposes to devise a general-purpose controller product, which can be            incorporated into a variety of rotary pump systems for clinical use.                                                                                                      The goal of the Phase-I effort proposed herein are to design a robust control        algorithm which may then be implemented, in Phase-Il, into an applications           specific integrated circuit. The P.I. envisions that this chip would be              made available to device developers much like control circuits produced by           Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments, etc., are adopted by a wide variety of           users for their specific products.                                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Direct application to virtually all rotary-type blood pumps for critical care and chronic use.  The P.I. envisions that the Antakamatics control chip would be made available to device  developers much like integrated circuits producted by Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments,   etc. are adopted by a wide variety of users for their specific products.  The market for  this product is estimated to exceed 200,000 units per annum, and there currently exists  no competing product.                                                                                     n/a",PHYSIOLOGICAL CONTROLLER FOR ROTARY BLOOD PUMPS,6292387,R43HL066656,"['artificial intelligence', ' auxiliary heart prosthesis', ' biomedical device power system', ' biomedical equipment development', ' cardiac output', ' circulatory assist', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electrophysiology', ' microprocessor /microchip']",NHLBI,"ANTAKAMATICS, INC.",R43,2001,98465,0.0031336236818356126
"Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation   DESCRIPTION: Optical holography has been applied to non-invasive clinical            diagnosis and monitoring of Dental and oral/facial pathology, but has been           sharply limited in its usefulness by its requirements of high laser coherence.       absolute stability of setup. and wet processing of holograms. Physical Optics        Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a shearographic micro-optic camera as a        novel means of non-invasive Dental evaluation and characterization based on          shearing speckle interferometry, miniature camera imaging, and proprietary           neural network image processing. The innovation in this concept is the use of        shearography to avoid the need for high stability, high temporal coherence, and      wet processing. Nearfield shearography will have high spatial resolution, and        the neural network will perform real-time data processing and display.                                                                                                    The unique high resolution. real-time operation. low cost. and miniaturization       will make this device attractive to a large commercial market in Dental and          clinical applications.                                                                                                                                                    In Phase 1. POC will develop a miniature shearographic micro-optic camera            (SMOC) with fiber light delivery. a micro-CCD imaging component. and neural          network. It will be capable of distinguishing among tooth enamel, cementum,           dentine, pulp, and soft tissue.                                                      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This compact, low-cost, high resolution non-invasive shearography device will represent a  technological breakthrough not only for oral diagnostics but also for biomedical imaging in  general.  Because of its high resolution, real-time operation, and immunity to vibration, it will  also have wide applications beyond the medical field, particularly for industrial diagnostics.  High-strength aerospace composite material evaluation and testing as well as weld and pipe  defect inspection are areas where it will be particularly welcome.                                                                                     n/a",Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation,6404393,R43DE014307,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' dental disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fiber optics', ' image processing', ' interferometry', ' lasers', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' oral health', ' video recording system']",NIDCR,PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION,R43,2001,100000,-0.0209530927238308
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6340157,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2001,68753,-0.021887286614725165
"AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE Despite advances in pharrnacotherapy for hypertension, as many as 75% of hypertensive patients' blood pressure is poorly controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is largely attributed to failure to adhere with antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence to medication regimens is a long-standing phenomenon that increases health care utilization and costs. Existing research demonstrates that a theoretical framework is needed to advance our ability to design effective interventions. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to medication adherence suggests that the model has strong explanatory power in this area and has the potential to guide intervention development. Phase l of this Fast-Track proposal involves the development and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 70% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized trial of an adherence expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on adherence, offering far greater availability at a low cost. Applying the TTM to intervention development will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Up to 75% (37.5 million) of the 50 million Americans afflicted with hypertension fail to adhere to their medication regimen. Nonadherence with antihypertensives, which increases utilization of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency services, contributes a large proportion of drug-related morbidity and mortality the annual costs of which exceed $76 billion. Effective and cost-effective population-based adherence expert systems can reduce morbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and related costs, resulting in tremendous commercial potential.  n/a",AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE,6390534,R44HL063481,"['antihypertensive agents', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health care service utilization', ' human subject', ' hypertension', ' interactive multimedia', ' patient monitoring device', ' questionnaires', ' therapy compliance']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2001,391252,-0.012334001629174342
"Neural Network System for Detection of EEG Microsleeps   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): A software system based        on Artificial Neuro-fuzzy hybrid technology will be developed for automatic          detection of microsleep events from EEG data. The software system will be            designed for used as a model-free and rule-free classification tool that             achieves generalization power through learning from examples.   The development of the software system will require a Graphical User Interface       for data example selection, frequency-analytic preprocessing of EEG raw data,        feature extraction for microsleep characterization, design and training of           neural networks for single EEG channels, and a fuzzy system for contextual           combination of network response for multiple EEG channels to a single system         response.                                                                                                                       The training and testing of the neural networks will be based on a database of       visually scored examples of microsleep and non-microsleep events from                electrophysiological data, which will be randomly divided into training,             validation and test sets.                                                                                 The performnance of the software system will be evaluated based on the               false-positive and false-negative rate for the microsleep detection using data       examples unknown to the system. The agreement rate between the combined network      response and results from visual and conventional automatic scoring will be          used as additional evaluation parameter.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The software system will be an attractive tool for researchers, medical and technical  personal, industrial engineers. It enables the user to quantify alertness/sleepiness  in studies on sleep disorders, shiftwork, drug effects and fatigue countermeasures.  It will help reduce time-consuming visual scoring by human experts. In addition, it  will widen our knowledge about the rapid transition events (microsleeps) between  wake and sleep and can contribute to the development of alertness monitor systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Neural Network System for Detection of EEG Microsleeps,6338195,R43NS039711,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' electroencephalography', ' electrophysiology', ' human data', ' neural information processing', ' sleep']",NINDS,"CIRCADIAN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2001,93457,-0.06766995079856607
"STRESS MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEM FOR CANCER PREVENTION Stage matched interventions for stress management that are interactive and individualized, and are delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts. Computer based expert systems linked to self-help manuals can be as effective as Counselors but at much lower cost and greater accessibility. Stress is an important cause of cancer and other chronic and acute diseases and is one of the most costly behaviors in terms of health care, job performance and disability. Fifty million Americans do not practice effective stress management. Existing programs are action- oriented and are designed for the 30% of populations who are prepared to take action. Stage matched programs can meet the needs of all; the 45% in the Precontemplation stage and the 25% in the Contemplation stage. Phase I of this Fast-Track research will demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting 70% of at-risk populations and the acceptability of the expert system interventions. Phase II will complete recruitment of 1200 participants randomly assigned to treatment or control and can demonstrate efficacy of these interventions over six months.

"COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION There are approximately 2.5 million people in the US who are speech impaired to the extent that it is considered a functional limitation.  Today, many people with severe communication disabilities lack access to electronic and even printed material, have a lack of opportunity for interaction and opportunity for self-advocacy, and experience isolation.  Providing accessibility to wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device is of tremendous importance to people with severe communication disabilities. The primary objective under the Phase I grant was to investigate the potential of word-level disambiguation technology for text generation on a communication aid to meet the needs of many individuals requiring augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).  Phase I findings validated T9 technology as a viable method for text generation and also AAC device users want to access wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device.  The specific aims of Phase II are to: investigate hardware platforms for AAC device host candidates, develop Windows software modules for T9 and AAC, develop portable AAC resources, integrate wireless voice and data communications, and conduct usability testing of the product as it develops. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION The outcome of Phase II will be a communication aid device for production in Phase III that is based on commercially available hardware with minimal custom AAC hardware support.  The goal is that the software platform developed in Phase II will be ported to existing low-cost hardware as much as possible to: make use of newly developed platforms, provide more choice to AAC device users, provide more flexibility in user interface, and reduce overall device costs to the end user when commercially manufactured.  n/a",COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION,6188611,R44RR013191,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' clinical research', ' communication disorder aid', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' computer system hardware', ' human subject', ' online computer', ' vocabulary', ' voice']",NCRR,"MADENTEC (USA), INC.",R44,2001,316991,-0.0004813470973759278
"A Personal Status Monitor for the Home The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The MA will primarily augment clinical service by making the line an effective place for rehabilitation. In addition, the PSM will have direct applicability to the field of ergonomics for work-site assessment, or in sports or recreational activities as a feedback device to facilitate training of skilled movements. Numerous other applications in the field of rehabilitation could include monitoring of drug therapies for tremor or other neuromuscular conditions, or home-exercise compliance.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6383999,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2001,200999,-0.020403485758511225
"Nosocomial infections: Automated typing and data mining   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nosocomial infections cause about 90,000        deaths annually in the U.S. and have an associated medical care cost of about        3.5 billion dollars. Despite being the fourth leading cause of death, there has      been limited development of rapid, integrated tools for determination of             outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections. The goal of the proposed research is      to test feasibility of development of software algorithms for identifying            clusters of bacteria involved in nosocomial infections. This will be                 accomplished by creation of new algorithms for clustering bacterial fatty acid       composition data to detect infection clusters and through the creation of a          ""data mining"" algorithm to provide patient demographic information needed to         distinguish nosocomial outbreaks from community-acquired infections or               pseudo-outbreaks. These software algorithms will be integrated into the MIDI         Sherlock Microbial Identification System as a fully automated real-time              epidemiology tool. Hospital infection-control personnel will be able to use the      output to immediately implement infection control measures, and thus to reduce       the impact of nosocomial infections.

"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.                                                                                                                                                      During Phase I, we developed signal processing algorithms that permit            noninvasive assessment of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.           T algorithms were tested on patient data and found to assist clinicians          in predicting patient response to cardioversion in an attempt to                 terminate the arrhythmia and restore sinus rhythm.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6467733,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2001,607570,-0.009203244524330112
"MULTICHANNEL EEG DATA COMPRESSION Recently, recording high-resolution Electroencephalograms (EEGs) from            a large number of electrodes has become a clear trend in both brain              research and clinical diagnosis.  However, the current EEG data                  acquisition systems store the collected data in a form that has never            changed since digital EEG emerged about 30 years ago.  As a result, the          size of the output data file increases enormously as the number of               recording channels increases, causing various problems including high            costs in data analysis, database management, archiving, and transmission         through the internet.                                                                                                                                             This proposal seeks to solve this problem through fundamental research           on data compression specifically for EEG data, but applicable to other           physiological data as well.  Our key approach is based on the                    application of advanced mathematical and signal processing technologies          to this critical problem.  We will develop and optimize a variable               sampling technique which eliminates redundant data samples using spline          interpolation and wavelet transformation.  We will also investigate              lossless data compression algorithms that possess two important                  features: 1) any part of the data within the compressed file can be read         without having to decompress the entire file, and 2) the compressed data         can be transmitted and presented in coarse or fine resolutions as                needed.  We expect that, using both variable sampling and lossless               compression, the EEG file size can be reduced by approximately 70                percent.                                                                          n/a",MULTICHANNEL EEG DATA COMPRESSION,6363936,R01NS038494,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' digital imaging', ' electroencephalography', ' human data', ' human subject', ' informatics', ' technology /technique development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2001,177776,-0.021742301904872453

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample. The design is       a 4-group (Control, Modular Expert System intervention, Telecommunications           Intervention, Integrated Expert System Intervention) x 3 occasions (0, 12, and       24 months). Each behavioral risk factor will be intervened upon for 12 months        and the 3 risk factors will be related simultaneously. The 3 interventions           evaluated in this project have the potential to be easily disseminated at low        costs to entire populations of at-risk individuals.                                                                                                                       n/a",Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks,6400426,R01CA085807,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer prevention', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer human interaction', ' cost effectiveness', ' dietary lipid', ' education evaluation /planning', ' exercise', ' human subject', ' lifestyle', ' neoplasm /cancer education', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition education', ' nutrition related tag', ' saturated fat', ' smoking', ' smoking cessation', ' tobacco abuse', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,R01,2001,813357,-0.02272900869611284
"Allergy Alerts in Computerized Physician Entry   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):                                                 Computerized physician order entry (POE) has helped reduce medication errors,        and a substantial amount of error reduction stems from its allergy alerting          function. However, our experience has taught us that these systems should be         improved for safer medication delivery. We recently performed an analysis of         the user responsiveness to allergy alerts, and found that it was lower than          expected (50% in 1994); moreover it had been declining for several years (to         20% in 1999).                                                                                                                                                             In our analysis, we learned several lessons. One is that the allergy screening       software may be too richly cross-referenced, and therefore generates excessive       alerts. In addition, some allergy alerts are consistently ignored based on           accepted clinical practice, but their importance has not been tested. Also,          present systems lack stratification of allergy severity, and fail to                 distinguish between medication tolerance and true allergies. By over-alerting,       the overall integrity of the system is degraded.                                                                                                                          We seek to improve the computer-based intelligence of the allergy alerting           process. Our study is designed to accomplish several goals. We will evaluate         the frequency and significance of adverse drug events that resulted from             overridden allergy alerts. Next, we will determine if distinguishing true            allergic reactions from symptoms of medication intolerance will result in            improved compliance to allergy alerts. Finally, we aim to design an allergy          classification system that incorporates severity analysis that would otherwise       be performed off-line by pharmacist oversight.

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.

The technologies used are appropriate for use in distance learning programs,  and can be used by individuals to educate themselves.                                                                                     n/a",Educational Tools for Neuroscience,6403961,R43MH065842,"['computer assisted instruction', ' computer simulation', ' educational resource design /development', ' interactive multimedia', ' neurobiology', ' science education']",NIMH,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2001,100000,-0.011127168526614049
"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription. We will directly sell our software products and services to Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and to Transcription Services Companies.  n/a",Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems,6404288,R44LM006930,"['computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' language', ' medical records', ' speech recognition', ' telemedicine', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"ESCRIPTION, INC.",R44,2001,673495,-0.05851295142586569

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6054979,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2000,593340,-0.007313305627968528

"IMPROVED COLLIMATION FOR PIXELATED RADIATION DETECTORS   DESCRIPTION: The investigators propose to test the feasibility of developing         improved collimators for use with higher performance pixelated detectors under       development for use in gamma cameras now under development, as further               described by their abstract:                                                                                                                                              ""In nuclear medicine, the collimator plays a critical role in the formation of       a projection image of the radiopharmaceutical distribution within a patient.         The current state-of-the-art of collimator design for Nuclear Medicine has           matured, under the assumption that gamma-ray detectors have an intrinsic             position dependant Gaussian response function. A fundamental rethinking of           collimator design is necessary to optimize collimation for solid state               detectors that have a fixed intrinsic rect function response. We will construct      design tools by first developing a mathematical model of collimation for             detectors with intrinsic pixels and then implement it by computer algorithms.        We will conduct experiments to measure performance and validate the simulation       tools. Using the validated simulator we will then explore novel collimator           designs and hole patterns. We will examine all proposed designs for                  sensitivity, resolution, cost and manufacture. To advance clinical                   applications, collimator design will need to keep pace with the anticipated          improvements in detector technology.

"A PERSONAL STATUS MONITOR FOR THE HOME We propose to develop and evaluate a wireless Personal Status Monitor (PSM) that can monitor the use of musculature in a continuous and unobstructive fashion while a subject performs normal and usual daily activities in the home. This innovation will provide the caregiver specific information describing their patient's physical and functional performance in the home, without relying on self-reports or having the patient leave the home environment. The PSM will consist of three components: I) wireless sensors to detect the electromyographic (BMG) signal, 2) a small body-worn transceiver, and 3) a base station, which processes the signals for feature extraction and transmission to the caregiver. The proposed Phase l program will focus on the development of methods to recognize specific functional tasks based solely on surface EMG signals. We propose to develop and evaluate pattern recognition algorithms using neural networks for processing EMG signals obtained from healthy subjects during the performance of specific functional tasks selected from the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Proof of concept will be achieved by demonstrating that it is possible to accurately distinguish between these tasks using no more than 4 EMG sensors, even when extraneous motor activity is present. The commercial development of a PSM for the home will be continued during Phase II by: 1) designing and building the hardware, 2) developing the application software, and 3) expanding the development of intelligent algorithms to additional functional activities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development of a new method for monitoring functional activity in the home. The innovation will rely on technological achievements involving wireless sensors and telemedicine to surpass the capability of current methods to measure functional activity in the home. It will replace, or augment, the current reliance on self-report questionnaires, non-specific physical activity monitors, and frequent home care or clinic visits to establish a patient record of physical activity in the home.

"CLINICAL RESEARCH TOWARD CLOSED LOOP INSULIN DELIVERY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The ""closed-loop                artificial pancreas,"" a device that would measure glucose level and              deliver insulin automatically as needed, has been an elusive goal in the         treatment of diabetes. There are three essential components: the blood           glucose sensor, linking algorithms and the delivery system. For the first        time, a viable sensor and a proven delivery system are now available for         research. The broad goal of this clinical research proposal is to complete       the studies needed to link the sensor to the delivery system, paving the         way for a functional closed-loop artificial pancreas. First, we will make        a detailed analysis of sensor signal as it reflects glucose level in             normal and diabetic humans. Second, we will study the precise                    pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery by external and implantable insulin         pumps. Third, analysis of these two data sets will provide the basis for         algorithms that link the sensor signal to insulin delivery. A formal             safety analysis will evaluate the safety features needed in a closed loop        device. In the last year of the project, the entire system will be tested        and fine-tuned. This project takes advantage of our relatively extensive         investigational experience with mechanical insulin delivery pumps in             people with diabetes, and the recent availability, for research, of a            subcutaneously placed, glucose oxidase-based continuous glucose sensor.          The investigators have established experienced with clinical research in         diabetes, and the resources of an excellent General Clinical Research            Center. The co-investigators have extensive experience with mathematical         modeling of biologic systems. There is a close working relationship              between the research team and the manufacturer of the sensor and pumps, as       reflected by the Interactive Research Project Grant collaboration, and by        a long-standing history of collaboration. It is essential to emphasize           that we do not anticipate completion of a manufacturable, clinically             usable, commercially viable artificial pancreas within the time-frame of         this work. Rather, we aim to complete the basic studies and modeling             analyses that would form the basis of such a system, and demonstrate the         feasibility of linking the sensor to the delivery device. If these studies       and these trials were successful, they would be a major step towards             development of a clinically useful close-loop artificial pancreas.                n/a",CLINICAL RESEARCH TOWARD CLOSED LOOP INSULIN DELIVERY,6177804,R01DK055132,"['artificial endocrine pancreas', ' artificial intelligence', ' biosensor device', ' clinical research', ' drug delivery systems', ' glucose metabolism', ' human subject', ' insulin', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' medical implant science', ' pharmacokinetics']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,252566,0.001498928185819027
"CLUSTERING AND HYPER-LINKING OF LONG-TERM EEGS The proposed work offers enhancements to the MagicMarker software developed in Phase I.  This software offers a new methodology for the display and analysis of long-term EEG records.  Epochs of similar activity are grouped into segments and then states via two-pass hierarchial clustering.  This results in clearly differentiated background, paroxysmal activity and patient state transitions.  The underlying EEG  is always available via hyper- links so that artifacts can be distinguished from ""real EEG."" The Phase II work adds classification abilities (intelligence) to the Phase I software.  Proposed are an expert-level seizure detector, an ICU abnormality detector and a user-defined activity detector.  The effort includes the development of a large library of carefully analyzed and annotated prolonged EEG studies. Newborns, older children and adults will be included ensuring robust algorithms for all age groups. The proposed software greatly reduces staff requirements for long-term monitoring through intelligent notification (visual, audible and dial-up pager) of interesting events.  This, in addition to the ability to monitor patients ""away from the lab,"" provides more frequent patient checks and improved clinical outcomes. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION The proposed software would be a valuable addition to any digital EEG because of the great timesavings it provides for both neurologists and EEG technicians.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION OF CLINICAL DATA Abstractions of time-stamped clinical data are useful for planning               therapy, for monitoring therapy, and for creating high-level summaries of        time-oriented clinical databases.  Temporal abstractions also support            explanations by an intelligent patient-record system and can be used for         representation of the goals and intentions of clinical guidelines and            protocols.                                                                                                                                                        We propose to reengineer and expand the scope of the RESUME system, a            prototype computer program that implements the knowledge-based temporal-         abstraction method, a conceptual and computational framework that we have        developed for abstraction of time-stamped clinical data into clinically          meaningful interval-based concepts. RESUME has been evaluated with highly        encouraging results in several clinical areas. We will address the               practical and theoretical issues of representation, acquisition,                 maintenance, and reuse of temporal-abstraction knowledge. Our specific           aims are defined by a four-step research plan:                                                                                                                    1. We will define formally the knowledge requirements for five                   computational modules (mechanisms) we employ, thus facilitating the              acquisition, maintenance, reuse, and sharing of the required knowledge.                                                                                           2. We will enhance, expand, and redesign five computational temporal-            abstraction mechanisms:                                                          (a) Automatic formation of meaningful contexts for interpretation of             clinical data.

(c) Temporal inference (e.g., the join of certain interval-based clinical        abstractions into longer ones).                                                  (d) Interpolation between temporally disjoint clinical abstractions,             including a development of a probabilistic representation and semantics.

"WAVELET-BASED AUTOMATED CHROMOSOME IDENTIFICATION Commercial automated karyotyping instruments have improved to the point where the major factor limiting throughput is the time required for operator correction of chromosome classification errors. An improvement in chromosome classification accuracy would significantly increase the value of these instruments in cytogenetics labs. The goal of this project is to develop and commercialize significantly improved chromosome measurement and classification techniques for automated karyotyping. Currently the best-performing chromosome classification approach uses Weighted Density Distribution (WDD) features [11] to quantify the banding pattern of the chromosomes. These are computed as inner products between the banding profile and a set of WDD basis functions. The particular set of 1unctions originally proposed by Granum [11,38] has come into widespread use. In Phase I we showed that better function sets exist and that our new approach can find better WDD features than the best currently used. We have an innovative wavelet-based method for generating WDD functions and a chromosome classification testbed which supports large scale classification experiments. We propose to conduct a thorough, methodical search for better performing basis functions in Phase II. Phase III will incorporate the technology into PSI's PowerGene automated karyotyping instruments.

"MICRO-OPTICS-BASED DIGITAL ALLERGEN COUNTER The current pollen identification and counting method based on microscopic visual examination is very time consuming and labor intensive. More importantly, it is very ""subjective"" and not truly scientific. Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a portable digital allergen counter (DAC) to accurately and reliably count and identify airborne pollen grains and fungal spores. The proposed DAC combines a micro-image scanner, a high-speed video chip, an allergen morphology data bank, and a built-in image processor into an integrated and automated pollen counter. The DAC will rapidly identify and quantify pollen, grains and spores. By making it much easier to collect allergen information in multiple locations, the proposed device will reduce morbidity by providing improved warnings on days with high pollen counts. The specific aims of the Phase I project are to design and construct optical image scanner suitable for allergen detection, identify the morphology of several types of pollen, grains, and spores, integrate the DAC system and test and evaluate the system feasibility. In Phase II, an engineering prototype of a portable instrument will be built and field-validated with real-world samples. We will also expand its capability to increase the pollen types of interest.

"PERMUTATION TEST SOFTWARE FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of a randomized clinical trial are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. Most hypothesis tests used for analyzing clinical trials assume a population model for statistical inference, when in fact a randomization model is more consistent with the way randomized clinical trials are actually conducted. Failure to consider the randomization model when analyzing clinical trials can lead to effective drugs being declared ineffective, and ineffective drugs being declared effective. In order to analyze clinical trials in accordance with the randomization model, sophisticated software for conducting permutation tests is needed. The overall goal of this research is to develop flexible and robust software, usable by statisticians or other medical data analysts, for conducting permutation tests for single- or multi-clinic randomized clinical trials. The ongoing advances in computing technology have created a favorable climate for development of software for conducting permutation tests. This project includes a collaboration with Dr. Rosenberger of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County who is a recognized expert on randomization based inference and adaptive designs. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Software that can use general permutation tests to analyze clinical trial data would have clear commercial value to clinical research organizations in academia, Government, and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries.

"AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE Despite advances in pharrnacotherapy for hypertension, as many as 75% of hypertensive patients' blood pressure is poorly controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is largely attributed to failure to adhere with antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence to medication regimens is a long-standing phenomenon that increases health care utilization and costs. Existing research demonstrates that a theoretical framework is needed to advance our ability to design effective interventions. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to medication adherence suggests that the model has strong explanatory power in this area and has the potential to guide intervention development. Phase l of this Fast-Track proposal involves the development and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 70% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized trial of an adherence expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on adherence, offering far greater availability at a low cost. Applying the TTM to intervention development will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Up to 75% (37.5 million) of the 50 million Americans afflicted with hypertension fail to adhere to their medication regimen. Nonadherence with antihypertensives, which increases utilization of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency services, contributes a large proportion of drug-related morbidity and mortality the annual costs of which exceed $76 billion.

It will be extremely             important to have a robust set of tools to assist in this process.  Partial      prototype versions of certain of these tools already exist.                                                                                                       1.  The project will refine and extend computer-based tools for immunization     knowledge maintenance.  These tools will include:  a) IMM/Def, a program         which automatically generates the rule-based logic for the most complex          portion (""kernel"") of IMM/Serve's knowledge, and b) IMM/Test, a program          which automatically generates a set of test cases to help test the kernel        logic.  The project will also develop an organized set of strategies for         immunization test case generation, and implement those strategies in the         refined version of IMM/Test.                                                                                                                                      2.  The project will build a Web site to support immunization knowledge          maintenance.                                                                                                                                                      3.  The project will keep a detailed record of all modifications and             customization of the knowledge, and will represent all the variations of the     knowledge using a standardized format such as GLIF, the Guideline                Interchange Format being developed as a standard for exchanging guidelines       between sites.                                                                                                                                                    4.  The project will link IMM/Serve to a database designed to hold               IMM/Serve's analysis of a set of cases, so that the resulting package can be     used as a tool to perform compliance assessment.                                                                                                                  5.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6062376,R21CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2000,154460,-0.009203244524330112
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.                                                                                                                                                      During Phase I, we developed signal processing algorithms that permit            noninvasive assessment of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.           T algorithms were tested on patient data and found to assist clinicians          in predicting patient response to cardioversion in an attempt to                 terminate the arrhythmia and restore sinus rhythm.

"WEIGHT MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR DIABETES Approximately 90% of individuals with NIDDM are overweight. Overweight can exacerbate the course of the disease and co-morbid conditions, increasing health care utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight management are costly and serve only a small percentage of at risk individuals. Thus, population-based behavior change programs may be necessary to reach larger percentages of at risk individuals more cost- effectively. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to health behaviors involved in weight management suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves the customization and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 50% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized clinical trial of a comprehensive weight management expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary to develop more effective and cost- effective interventions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Overweight and obesity are costly to all participants in the health care delivery system. Over 90% of the 15 million adults with NIDDM are overweight, which increases healthcare utilization, morbidity, and mortality.

"MULTICHANNEL EEG DATA COMPRESSION Recently, recording high-resolution Electroencephalograms (EEGs) from            a large number of electrodes has become a clear trend in both brain              research and clinical diagnosis.  However, the current EEG data                  acquisition systems store the collected data in a form that has never            changed since digital EEG emerged about 30 years ago.  As a result, the          size of the output data file increases enormously as the number of               recording channels increases, causing various problems including high            costs in data analysis, database management, archiving, and transmission         through the internet.                                                                                                                                             This proposal seeks to solve this problem through fundamental research           on data compression specifically for EEG data, but applicable to other           physiological data as well.  Our key approach is based on the                    application of advanced mathematical and signal processing technologies          to this critical problem.  We will develop and optimize a variable               sampling technique which eliminates redundant data samples using spline          interpolation and wavelet transformation.  We will also investigate              lossless data compression algorithms that possess two important                  features: 1) any part of the data within the compressed file can be read         without having to decompress the entire file, and 2) the compressed data         can be transmitted and presented in coarse or fine resolutions as                needed.  We expect that, using both variable sampling and lossless               compression, the EEG file size can be reduced by approximately 70                percent.                                                                          n/a",MULTICHANNEL EEG DATA COMPRESSION,6165278,R01NS038494,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' digital imaging', ' electroencephalography', ' human data', ' human subject', ' informatics', ' technology /technique development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2000,172553,-0.021742301904872453
"INTERACTIVE MEDIA FOR WOMEN CONSIDERING HORMONE THERAPY The long-term goal of Phase I and Phase II is to create a series of bilingual (Spanish/English), bicultural, interactive CD-ROMs dealing with issues related to menopause and aging, with specific emphasis on Hispanic women. This proposal will result in a CD-ROM about Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) that takes 15-3O minutes to use and will test its value in a controlled study. Through an interactive decision-tree that specifies individual risk factors and lifestyle preferences, the CD-ROM will help users identify their options, including HRT, lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet, and other alternatives. Besides providing information, the CD-ROM will be designed to improve decision-making and increase women's confidence in their ability to make informed choices. Although it may increase the risk of cancer, HRT relieves short-term menopausal symptoms, and appears to offer long-term benefits of reduced risk for heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis. Over 40 million women will pass through menopause in the next two decades. Studies have shown that Hispanic women are less familiar with HRT and less likely to use it than non-Hispanic white women. In addition, Hispanas approach medical care with their own set of cultural values. Interactive media offer personalization, enhanced learning through multiple sensory input, and a cost-effective method of providing information in a managed care environment or busy individual practice. This is an innovative application of existing technology to provide patient education. Possible topics for Phase II include osteoporosis, heart disease, depression, and stroke. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Educational media is a $3B market. Print and video materials on HRT and menopause are available, but little exists as interactive media, in Spanish, and/or is culturally-relevant to Hispanics.

"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10043768,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'structured data', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,253379,-0.031664542186265715
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9941090,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,605875,-0.02943423118416605
"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project.

"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity.

"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'memory care', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,-0.025044460561443403
"A Machine Learning-Based Mobile Application and Cloud Platform to Enable Accurate and Streamlined Surveillance of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection and Schistosomiasis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis affect 2 billion people and have significant detrimental effects on health. Strategies to implement STH and schistosomiasis interventions currently rely on testing for these parasites by microscopic analysis of stool samples to detect parasite eggs and identify egg species. Accurate surveillance testing and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making at the programmatic level to implement infection control strategies. Approaches that increase the speed and standardize the accuracy of microscopy-based testing and streamline reporting could help eliminate STH infections and schistosomiasis. We propose to develop a mobile phone-based STH-schistosome egg identification and counting tool that employs machine learning (deep learning) and works in the absence of an internet connection. With this app, users will collect surveillance data for integration into a cloud platform. Surveillance data can then be visualized in dashboards to inform interventions to control disease. Our approach is fundamentally different from other published work that develop machine learning algorithms for STH and schistosomiasis because it will very accurately identify egg types during surveillance activities, and it will be available to users in an app and integrate with cloud storage and reporting. Our interdisciplinary team combines the expertise of global health researchers, product usability testing experts, microscopists, and data scientists. In the R21 phase, we will collect the largest ever microscopy image set of STH and schistosome eggs (> 15 000). We will train an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks that make highly accurate parasite egg classification (species identification) and embed this algorithm into a mobile app that works without internet connectivity. To promote app utility, we will evaluate its accuracy and usability in a surveillance setting. We established the feasibility of our approach in preliminary data by building a web app that serves the results of a deep learning model that identifies STH and schistosome eggs with > 98% accuracy. The R33 phase will be only undertaken if well-defined milestones are achieved. We will further develop the mobile app as a data capture system that will integrate with cloud storage and a dynamic data visualization system to enable increased accuracy in STH and schistosomiasis surveillance over time and across geographic location. ​Validation studies will assess the​ benefits of the system to time and cost savings and quality of data collected during surveillance activities. The overall goal of this work is to increase the accuracy and streamline STH and schistosomiasis surveillance to enable effective decision-making in disease control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate surveillance testing in the field and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making by soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and schistosomiasis control and prevention programs.

"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,9943875,R01EY031331,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,341800,-0.016205252500006713
"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9989850,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'data fusion', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,312918,-0.0142954580840274
"Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia ABSTRACT In this competitive revision, within the same scope of developing and deploying algorithms to make a quantum leap in clinical diagnosis as that in our current U01EB021183, we would like to revise the original aims to add a new Aim to leverage our expertise in the areas of algorithm development and clinical translation to make immediate contributions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we propose to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enable chest x-ray radiography (CXR) as an alternative diagnostic tool to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia, to rapidly triage patients for appropriate treatment, to monitor the treatment response in a contained environment, and to optimize the distribution of the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, our overarching objective is to develop automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 related pneumonia from other non-COVID-19 related pneumonia using CXR images. The advantages of the proposed AI equipped CXR technique include: i) widely available, ii) inexpensive, iii) excellent coronavirus exposure profile for patient, technologist, and equipment, and iv) rapid and automated DL interpretation, which is effectively instantaneous.",Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia,10156179,U01EB021183,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology', 'Anosmia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilateral', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Case Study', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Containment', 'Coronavirus', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'North America', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rural', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'War', 'World Health Organization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'combat', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging facilities', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'neural network architecture', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'quantum', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'urgent care']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U01,2020,605070,-0.030264546927615526
"ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of Americans are in need of evidence-based counseling, such as motivational interviewing (MI), for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) each year. To develop competence in an evidence-based practice like MI, trainees require ample opportunities for practice and immediate, performance-based feedback on the skills that they are learning. However, this is challenging if not impossible to offer at scale -- to the large number of providers in need of training. Opportunities for practice typically rely on roleplays with other trainees with limited experience, and feedback requires either direct supervision from an expert trainer or behavioral coding from a trained coding team; these are costly, limited, and time consuming. AI-based technology can meet this need, generating many opportunities for practice, and providing regular, actionable feedback. Many practice opportunities coupled with rapid, performance-based feedback can enhance and expand training in evidence-based counseling for AUDs in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.  Lyssn.io​, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. ​Lyssn’s​ team includes expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous research demonstrated the basic utility of a prototype conversational agent (ClientBot) for training counselors. Currently, ClientBot simulates a general mental health client who can engage in open-ended interaction with trainees and provides immediate, performance-based feedback to trainees using machine learning.  The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal partners ​Lyssn​ with Prevention Research Institute (PRI), who has a long track-record of training counselors in evidence-based approaches for AUD and currently trains approximately 1,250 counselors per year. Phase I will adapt ClientBot to an AUD training context, including understanding PRI training workflows, assessing usability, and accuracy of machine learning based MI feedback. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a randomized training trial (N = 200 PRI trainees) to evaluate the effectiveness of ClientBot on learning of MI skills compared to a wait-list and PRI training-as-usual. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change underlying ClientBot’s MI skills training. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on role plays with peers and human judgment for training and performance-based feedback and support commercialization of a ClientBot product for training of AUD counselors in evidence-based practices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Training counselors in evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) requires repeated opportunities for skills practice with performance-based feedback, which is challenging to provide at scale. Building on an existing prototype, ​Lyssn.io​ – a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies – will enhance and evaluate an AI-based, conversational agent (ClientBot) that simulates a realistic client with alcohol concerns and provides performance-based feedback to support counselor training.",ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD,10009084,R44AA028463,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention Research', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Role', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Sports', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Vision', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'alcohol testing', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral health', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'peer', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIAAA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,397456,-0.04176948382402948
"Closing the loop on markerless object tracking Abstract/Summary Tracking the movements of objects and parts of objects - referred to as pose estimation - is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex behavior. Characterizing dynamic behaviors of animals (and other systems) is central to many disciplines, including computer science, physics, ethology, kinesiology, and sports medicine. Here we focus on neuroscience, where linking brain activity to associated dynamic behaviors is critical for both understanding normal function as well as effects of injury, disease, or degeneration. Invasive methods for measuring behavior are highly accurate, but require placement of sensors that may themselves interact with behavior and which may be susceptible to deterioration or infection. Video provides a non-invasive approach to characterizing behavior over time. Extracting behavior from video streams has, historically, been a slow and laborious process. Recent work in machine learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs), though, has revolutionized this process, making the analysis of complex video far easier and more accurate. While these systems are highly flexible, they were not designed for real time use, meaning that large video files must first be stored to disk for subsequent analysis. This poses two problems that this proposal will attempt to address. First, there is significant cost and management challenges associated with storage of large video stores, forming a practical barrier for adoption of this important technology for characterizing behavior. Second, estimates related to behavioral state are not available in real time so they cannot be used to control the experiment. We will develop a research methodology for “closing the loop”, by taking the networks trained by an existing and highly successful markerless object tracking system (DeepLabCut) and optimizing them for real time inference. After the system is functional, verified, and benchmarked, it will be shared with the community through open source repositories. Project Narrative Understanding the neural basis underlying complex behavior requires careful analysis of the dynamics of moving objects. Recent advances in computer vision has greatly facilitated our ability to track objects from video, but these tools are currently limited to offline analysis. Here we propose to build a system that addresses this problem by “closing the loop” using real time inference to be freely shared with the public to enhance ongoing research across the neuroscience spectrum.",Closing the loop on markerless object tracking,10047656,R03MH123990,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethology', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'haptics', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'sensor', 'time use', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,162500,-0.030728613751462613
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9974350,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2020,459252,-0.026917963865264138
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Testing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contact Lenses', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Glass', 'Industrialization', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neural Retina', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'gene therapy', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoscale', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'restoration', 'scaffold', 'stem cell therapy', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'translational approach', 'vision science', 'wearable device']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,-0.025381552000871388
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9993993,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670354,-0.03655542503964615
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic.

"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"SBIR Phase I- Topic 410 - Cancer Clinical Trials Recruitment and Retention Tools for Participant Engagement.  Many clinical trials fail to meet their accrual and retention goals, which leads to delays, early termination, or inability to draw conclusions at trial completion due to loss of statistical power.

"DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based data analytics and cloud computing platform, paired with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared wearable devices, to create a personalized baseline index that could indicate a change in health status for patients who have tested COVID-19 positive.  The project involves the development and validation of a COVID-19 Decompensation Index (CDI) that builds off physIQ’s existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics platform.  Data will be collected from 400 human subjects that are both pre-hospitalization subjects (found to be positive for COVID-19) and subjects that have been hospitalized and treated for COVID and then discharged.  This combined population will consist of COVID-19 decompensation cases (event cases) and cases for which COVID-19 did not result in any kind of decompensation (non-event cases).  The 400-patient dataset will be partitioned into a training subset and a testing subset.  Performance will be assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) as the metric of performance.  Data collected under this project will be deidentified and securely transmitted to an NIH data hub. n/a",DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION,10274152,5N91020C00040,"['Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biosensor', 'COVID-19', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hospitalization', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Secure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational platform', 'coronavirus disease', 'data hub', 'digital', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'wearable device']",NCI,"VGBIO, INC.",N01,2020,2305814,-0.01494207204216583
"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Phase II: Verification and validation of RESCU will be completed, culminating in third-party validation testing and certification. Finally, we will complete a clinical assessment including self-reporting subjective measures, and real-world usage metrics in a long-term clinical study. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control,10078697,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Calibration', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'empowerment', 'functional improvement', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning algorithm', 'myoelectric control', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prosthesis control', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2020,64079,0.01659637966544214
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10131449,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'combat', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2020,457208,-0.031194968326319118
"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,-0.031904503545359335
"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events.

"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Bluetooth', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cattle', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Wireless Technology', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'innovation', 'left ventricular assist device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'ventricular assist device', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,-0.02297855947200163
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes. n/a",Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry,10023190,R01GM135927,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human Activities', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical sciences', 'multimodality', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2020,311680,-0.021991817952638496
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with.

"Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults Approximately 3 million young adults aged 18-44 years currently have diabetes in the United States. This number is projected to increase to ~5.8 million by 2060. Differentiating diabetes types is crucial, because the etiology, treatments, and outcomes of diabetes differ substantially by type. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for ~17% and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ~75% of total diabetes in US young adults. This distribution of diabetes types continuously evolves. We do not have a large-scale surveillance system to monitor the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The widespread use and increasing functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems substantially increase the quantity, breadth, and timeliness of data available for surveillance and reduce costs compared with population-based registries and surveys. EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~6 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adults from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US young adults with those in young adults from other countries and regions. This study is innovative, because it will detect a false negative rate as low as 0.2%, leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. This study will advance our understanding of the age, sex, racial/ethnic, and geographic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The obtained surveillance data will inform planning for healthcare needs, prioritize the allocation of healthcare resources, and reduce health disparities via identifying and prioritizing subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities. The burden of diabetes has been increasing considerably in recent decades in US young adults. However, there is no large-scale surveillance system for monitoring the burden of diabetes by type in US young adults. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and temporal trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US young adults according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults,10085448,U18DP006502,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,-0.055634423143243274
"Dense Life-log Health Analytics from Wearable Sensors using Functional Analysis and Riemannian Geometry Project Summary The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled lifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations SUMMARY As a result of recent and rapid advances of immunogenetical, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies, the accuracy and efficiency of donor-recipient immunogenetical matching are expected to be significantly improved. As such, traditional tissue banking practices are being severely challenged due to low cryopreservation throughput. Skin allograft transplantations are currently utilized for numerous clinical applications. In such applications, donor tissues are now typically utilized as “expensive bandages”, i.e. for temporary coverage, thereby requiring painful and damaging follow-on autotransplantation procedures. With tremendously improved skin graft cryopreservation methods coupled with use of HLA matching based on AI network, future tissue banking platforms can potentially provide grafts to be used as permanent and definitive treatment for patients, thereby bringing high impact to clinical applications and the healthcare industry. Based on CryoCrate’s novel ultra-fast (106 K/min on a sample surface) cooling technology platform (PCT/US2019/26162), this project aims to develop a highly efficient (approaching 100% post-thaw viability) tissue graft cryopreservation prototype system that requires no cryoprotectant. The post-thaw viability and functionality will be assessed by standard in vitro assays using porcine and human skin (research exempt) grafts and in vivo assays using a mouse model. After achieving these aims, in future phase II and III stages, CryoCrate and its academic collaborator will collaborate with a local Organ Procurement Organization (Mid-America Transplant) and a wound healing clinic (University of Missouri Hospital) for porcine and human skin transplantation studies and clinical trials. Narrative A novel skin graft cryopreservation technology that requires no cryoprotectant will be developed to significantly improve efficiencies for tissue banking and allograft transplantation practices. This project initiates collaboration between CryoCrate LLC and local stakeholders, and thereby paves a path to commercialization of a new generation of ultra‐fast tissue cryopreservation devices.",A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations,10011745,R43AI155070,"['Allografting', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Bandage', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cryopreserved Tissue', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Freeze Drying', 'Freezing', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunogenetics', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'In Vitro', 'Liquid substance', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Skin graft', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'skin allograft', 'success', 'transplant model', 'two-dimensional', 'wound healing']",NIAID,"CRYOCRATE, LLC",R43,2020,160371,-0.025186709615733785
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,-0.01862582069841059
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9889974,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2020,575531,-0.017442826209531498
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research.

"Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance (GaCTSA) EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF TEST CENTERS FOR COVID-19 USING MACHINE LEARNING AND  ADAPTIVE SAMPLING ABSTRACT A critical task in managing and dealing with COVID-19 in communities is to perform diagnostic and/or antibody tests to identify diseased individuals. This information is critical to public health officials to estimate prevalence and transmission, and to effectively plan for required resources such as ICU beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and medical staff. Additionally, information on the number of infected people can be used to develop probabilistic and statistical models to estimate the reproduction number of the disease, and to predict the likely spatial and temporal trajectories of the outbreak. This provides vital information for planning actions and preparing policies and guidelines for social-distancing, school closures, remote work, community lockdown, etc. Despite the importance of diagnostic testing and identification of the positive cases, broad-scale testing is a challenging task particularly due to the limited number of test kits and resources. Our proposed research focuses on the development machine learning-based allocation strategies for determining the optimal location of COVID-19 test centers, including mobile and satellite centers, to minimize the local and global prediction uncertainties, maximize geographic coverage, associated with projections of spatio-temporal outbreak trajectories, and to improve efficient identification of diseased cases. EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF TEST CENTERS FOR COVID-19 USING MACHINE LEARNING AND  ADAPTIVE SAMPLING NARRATIVE Diagnostic and antibody tests for COVID-19 can provide invaluable information on prevalence and transmission of the disease. However, due to limited test capacity, broad-scale testing is currently not feasible. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a systematic and data-driven approach to defining testing strategies, in particular, determining the number and location of satellite and mobile testing centers (e.g., drive-through test locations). Our research program develops machine learning approaches to effectively allocate test centers for COVID-19 at the city, county, and state levels to accurately and reliably estimate the disease prevalence and its trajectory for resource planning and policy making, and to efficiently identify cases for treatment.",Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance (GaCTSA),10158891,UL1TR002378,"['Active Learning', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Biology', 'COVID-19', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Federal Government', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'disease transmission', 'environmental justice', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'transmission process']",NCATS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UL1,2020,225579,-0.025538979713960856
"Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users Project Summary Elderly wheelchair users experience wheelchair breakdowns every 2-3 months in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and rural areas of high-income countries. One in three breakdowns leads to adverse physical, social, psychosocial and economic consequences to wheelchair users which increases the public health and personal burden. Preventative wheelchair maintenance has been found to reduce the frequency of wheelchair breakdowns by ten-fold, but compliance with maintenance recommendations is extremely low because they are generic and not reflective of how and where the wheelchair is being used. To address this issue, we are developing a low-cost, scalable maintenance application that leverages artificial intelligence tools to provide maintenance recommendations tailored to how a wheelchair is used. The availability of low-cost technology and widespread use of smartphones by the elderly and people with disabilities in LMICs has led us to develop a smartphone application called WheelTrak that measures wheelchair wear as a function of usage in community. Based on the wear factors, the application produces a Wheelchair Wear Index (WWI) that is representative of wear of critical wheelchair parts that are prone to breakdown. Once a WWI threshold is reached, maintenance is required, and the application notifies the user and/or caregiver who can conduct maintenance to avoid breakdowns and related health consequences. We will conduct a data collection study in collaboration with our wheelchair industry partner – UCP Wheels in El Salvador – and characterize the WWI for the elderly by tracking wear factors which include user’s travel distance, ground shocks and surface vibrations using WheelTrak and a wheel sensor. Based on the trained WWI algorithm, a preventative maintenance schedule will be developed for older adults that can be employed through WheelTrak for maintenance reminders. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the application and gather barriers to maintenance. User feedback will assist us in improving WheelTrak for greater user satisfaction and compliance with maintenance, and addressing any personal or logistical challenges that elderly users and their caregivers or family members may face with conducting maintenance activities in LMICs. Findings from the proposed studies in this application will assist us in planning future studies to investigate the WWI-enabled WheelTrak tool as an intervention to prevent or reduce breakdowns and health consequences with the elderly in LMICs. Preventative maintenance of wheelchairs is necessary to reduce frequent wheelchair breakdowns and corresponding health consequences experienced by the elderly in adverse environments which are commonly present in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). WheelTrak is a smartphone application that measures real-time wheelchair wear in the community during use and triggers preventative maintenance reminders. In this study, we are modelling the application algorithm and collecting user and caregiver feedback to transform WheelTrak into a maintenance intervention tool for elderly wheelchair users in LMICs.",Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users,10095020,R03AG069836,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Economics', 'El Salvador', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Income', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care', 'Maintenance', 'Manual wheelchair', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Notification', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'User Compliance', 'Wheelchairs', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'low and middle-income countries', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2020,75877,-0.028343912600787828

"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future. Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s affects millions of individuals, at a great cost to public health and personal well-being. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in- person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access.

"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,-0.01034755424085467
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10019455,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,290216,-0.03703755166524944
"BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II “Code blue” is the signal used in hospitals to call for an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following a cardiac or respiratory arrest. Reviewing the performance of the “code blue team” is a cornerstone for improving outcomes. The current standard of using handwritten records on a paper “code sheet” does not allow measurement of key quality indicators and is subject to human error. In the Phase I STTR project, we developed an electronic device for complete recording of code blue events, called BlueBox. The BlueBox is a small electronic recorder on an adhesive patch to be placed on the left chest next to the mid-sternum. The prototype we developed in Phase I was successfully tested on high fidelity mannequins and on pigs. In Phase II, our goal is to complete the product development and testing and prepare the BlueBox for regulatory clearance and market launch. To achieve this goal, we propose 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to complete the product development of the BlueBox device and the software user interface (UI) for the “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype we developed in Phase I into a product ready for commercialization through rigorous product development processes. We will develop a mobile app for iPads with a software UI for the “electronic code sheet.” Aim 2 is to conduct human factors and usability engineering (HF/UE) testing and prepare for regulatory submission. The alpha prototype will undergo HF/UE testing in the Simulation Center. We will establish and maintain quality management records and conduct a pilot production run of 200 units of BlueBox. Aim 3 is to validate the BlueBox system in clinical studies. The objectives of the clinical study are: 1) to establish equivalence of the electronic code sheet to the current standard of paper code sheet; 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electronic code sheet in identifying key CPR quality indicators. We will conduct a code blue simulation study of 50 sessions on high fidelity mannequins with hospital code blue teams to compare BlueBox recording with paper code sheets. We will conduct a study of 30 healthy volunteers for BlueBox sensor validation. The criteria for successful development of the product will be that it passes all required regulatory testing and is validated in the clinical study for its equivalence and effectiveness in code blue recording. There will be two major milestones in this project: (1) finalizing product development with successful test production of 200 units; and (2) completing the clinical study and preparing for a 510(k) submission. Achieving the aims will result in a validated BlueBox system ready for submission to the FDA and commercialization. We intend to first introduce the BlueBox system to hospitals as a tool for staff training and quality improvement. We will continue the technology development with machine learning to provide instant feedback in the second generation BlueBox. Our ultimate goal is to minimize human error and improve patient outcomes through the BlueBox system’s better documentation and continuous feedback mechanism. Modified Specific Aims  “Code blue” is the alert used in hospitals to initiate immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following a cardiac or respiratory arrest.1 These situations are dire emergencies. Medical errors are likely to occur, and lives can be lost. Reviewing the performance quality of the “code blue team” is a cornerstone for improving outcomes of in-hospital arrests.2-4 Thorough and accurate recording of code blue events facilitates the detailed analyses needed for quality improvement.5-7 However, the current standard of using handwritten records on a paper “code sheet” does not allow measurement of key quality indicators and is subject to human errors. In our Phase I STTR project, we developed an electronic device for complete recording of code blue events, called BlueBox. The BlueBox is a small electronic recorder on an adhesive patch to be placed on the left chest next to the mid-sternum. It captures and records all code blue events -- vital signs, cardiac rhythm, verbal orders and their execution, chest compressions, cardioversion/defibrillation, procedures, medications, and labs. The prototype we developed in Phase I was successfully tested on high fidelity mannequins in the Simulation Center, and on pigs in the Animal Lab. The purpose of the BlueBox is to support medical training and quality improvement in code blue situations, and to enhance safety for patients undergoing CPR. In Phase II, our goal is to complete the product development and testing to prepare the BlueBox for regulatory clearance and market launch. To achieve this goal, we propose 3 Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Completing the product development of the BlueBox recorder and the software user interface (UI) for the “electronic code sheet” In Phase I, after developing the BlueBox technology and completing its proof-of-concept, the engineering prototype was tested successfully. The firmware drives all sensors and enables simultaneous recordings of all parameters with time stamps. The circuit can withstand 5kV, which is what is used in cardioversion and defibrillation. In Phase II, we will turn the prototype into a product ready for commercialization through rigorous product development processes. The product development processes include: miniaturization, mechanical design, industrial design, and usability engineering, as well as development of a mobile app for an iPad with an “electronic code sheet” user interface (UI) displaying the code blue events. To provide instant feedback during CPR, we will develop model-based and machine learning data analytics during and beyond the Phase II project. Specific Aim 2. Conducting human factors and usability testing, quality management and regulatory support and preparation We will conduct human factors and usability engineering (HF/UE) testing on the alpha prototype in the Simulation Center. The first HF/UE study aims to test the use of the BlueBox recorder by members and captains of the hospital code team in a code blue scenario. The second HF/UE study aims to test the software and UI of the electronic code sheet on iPads, as used by members of the hospital code blue team, hospital administrators, and EMR and IT specialists. We will establish and maintain quality management records and conduct a pilot production run of 200 units of BlueBox. The pilot run units will be tested for reliability and validity in the Simulation Center. We will request a pre-submission meeting (Qsub) with the FDA. In the Qsub meeting, we will discuss specific regulatory submission requirements and obtain feedback on the clinical validation study. Specific Aim 3. Validating the BlueBox system in clinical studies We will first conduct a prospective study of 50 sessions of simulated code blue resuscitations. Each session will be attended by a team of 4 clinicians-- a captain (physician), a nurse, an ancillary staff, and a code sheet recording staff (typically a nurse). We will also conduct a study of BlueBox sensor validation in 30 healthy volunteers. We will conduct a code blue simulation study on high fidelity mannequins with a hospital code blue team to compare BlueBox recording with paper code sheets. The objectives of the clinical studies are: 1) to establish equivalence of the electronic code sheet to the current standard of paper code sheet; 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electronic code sheet in identifying key CPR quality indicators specified in the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Feasibility Criteria: The criteria for successful development of the BlueBox are:1) it passes all required regulatory testing; 2) it is validated in the clinical study for its equivalence and effectiveness in code blue recording and quality review and improvement. Expected Outcomes and Impact: Two major milestones are (1) finalizing product development in Year 1, and (2) completing the clinical study in Year 2. Achieving the aims will result in a validated BlueBox system ready for regulatory submission to the FDA and commercialization. We intend to first market the BlueBox system to hospitals as a tool for staff training and quality improvement. We will continue the development of BlueBox technology with machine learning algorithms to provide instant feedback. Our ultimate goal is to minimize human error and improve patient outcomes through the BlueBox system’s continuous feedback mechanism. Debriefings and detailed reviews of the performance of the “code blue team” in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can improve quality of care and patient outcomes. In Phase I, we developed and successfully tested an electronic device, the BlueBox, for recording all CPR events and enabling full displays of code blue resuscitations in an “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype into a product ready for regulatory submission and commercialization in the proposed Phase II project.","BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II",9857035,R42GM113463,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adhesives', 'American Heart Association', 'Animals', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Code Blue', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Countershock', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Administrators', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Industrialization', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sternum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'commercialization', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'heart rhythm', 'human error', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile application', 'patient safety', 'product development', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"NEOVATIVE, INC.",R42,2020,821493,-0.008119970363821203
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Immobilization', 'Implant', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Older Population', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Skin Temperature', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sports Medicine', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Swelling', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'healing', 'high risk', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'physical therapist', 'post-operative rehabilitation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'rotator cuff tear', 'sensor', 'success', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'wireless communication']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,-0.05450049210462057

"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dietitian', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hyperphagia', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'design', 'drinking', 'image processing', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication nonadherence', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'privacy preservation', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,-0.027571621661484608
"Continuous Monitoring of COVID-19 Symptomatology for Elderly Patients in Long Term Care Facilities Using Advanced, Soft, and Flexible Sensors Mounted on the Suprasternal Notch PROJECT SUMMARY: COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly1 with the greatest risk in those cared for in long-term care facilities (LTCs) where mortality rates range from 19% to 72% worldwide. Monitoring COVID-19 infections in LTCs remains a particular challenging. The existing and a continued expected shortage of sufficient molecular COVID-19 testing coupled to false negative rates as high as 15% necessitates a critical need for new and complementary technologies that can surveil, alert, and track COVID-19 infections in this population. Our group are pioneers in the development of novel soft electronics. Our recent publication, supported by our active Phase I STTR, was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering detailing a next generation ultra-low profile, soft, and flexible sensor (ADAM) that continuously measures subtle acousto- mechanic signals generated by the body via an embedded high-frequency, 3-axis accelerometer in direct mechanical communication with the skin. The ADAM sensor communicates via Bluetooth with our custom mobile application for real time streaming as well as on sensor data storage enabling stand-alone operation. All data streams are cloud synchronized (HIPAA compliant). The highly novel soft, flexible nature allows for the ADAM sensor to be mountable on unusual locations of high information density. Specifically, we exploit the SN—the only location on the body where there is no dampening effect at the skin level with the intrathoracic cavity. This enables a SN- mounted ADAM sensor to capture heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature, physical activity (PA), swallow count, and talk time, along with additional novel respiratory biomarkers relevant to COVID-19. In this proposal, we propose to develop a new COVID-19 software package, machine learning enhancements to our cough algorithm, and validation in LTCs with both elderly patients and staff to evaluate usability, feasibility, and adherence. The high level of technology readiness with partner LTCs allows us to deploy efficiently to generate essential data for a future FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our team of experts in engineering, dermatology, gerontology, and machine learning are highly qualified to develop this COVID-19 surveillance system that offers both commercial and clinical value with broad applicability to a wide range of other respiratory and chronic medical conditions after the pandemic subsides. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly resident in long-term care facilities.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9930511,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'web portal', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,531691,-0.03393754261239094
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health.

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,-0.025160323508305875

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,-0.017088271838589804
"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",10000116,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,210334,-0.025897003480790763
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10017817,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,549226,-0.025512822431932945
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive.

We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,10142163,R01DK122473,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Elderly', 'Energy Intake', 'Feedback', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthy Eating', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastication', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'healthy weight', 'increased appetite', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'sucking', 'synergism', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'weight maintenance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2020,58911,-0.019585065647706786
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9924432,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,298890,-0.009671616745010245
"Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee Overview We propose to develop a design space framework and co-design methodology for the development of assistive self-care robot technologies that are informed by the social model of disability. Our model of assistive robots in the domain of self-care considers an individual's social and environmental context, coping processes and other factors that can affect independent functioning. Our design methods utilize embedded sensing to intelligently respond to these con- siderations. We speciﬁcally focus on assistive feeding tasks, proposing a formalism that enables a robotic system to feed a person with upper-extremity disability. Our guiding principle is that human-level interaction is feasible only if the robot itself relies on human-level semantics. We im- plement this principle by relying on data to learn and develop object-dependent control policies and timing models for acquiring and transferring a bite to a user at a proper time. The system's ob- server detects world states and arbitrator invokes different control policies based on these states. The tangible result will be an intelligent assistive feeding robot whose performance can generalize to different activities, adapt to user preferences, and recover from failures. Objectives and Relevance to NIH A design framework for assistive robots would provide for- malisms that let us address the fundamental challenge of designing robots that are responsive to context of use and support assisted self-care in a variety of social settings. We combine method- ologies from human-robot interaction, cognitive science, machine learning, robotics and haptics with user studies and our formalism to address the following research questions: (Q1) Mechanics of Feeding-Control Policies: How can control policies be designed for dexterous non-prehensile manipu- lation of deformable objects such as food? (Q2) Social Aspects of Feeding-Bite Timing: How should an assistive feeding robot decide the right timing for feeding a user? (Q3) Human-in-the-Loop: How can human-directed feedback be added into the loop for an autonomous assistive feeding system?  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks. This can in turn help them increase their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. While we presently focus on this spe- ciﬁc application, the tools and insights we gain can generalize to the ﬁelds of robotic assistance and human-robot interaction across other activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Thus, our work is clearly motivated by the intent to improve the quality of health and life of the aging population and is very relevant to the theme of NIH. 1 Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks, potentially increasing their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. The long-term promise of this research is to have robots in society that are able to seamlessly and ﬂuently perform complex manipulation tasks in dynamic human environments in real homes which could impact individuals with other disabilities as well as able-bodied individuals. Through improved access to independent living and customizing to the unique needs and preferences of users, the results of this project can positively impact mil- lions of people worldwide, especially given the vast variability in our target population by being transformational in the scalability of assistive robotics for self-care. 1",Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities,9907705,F32HD101192,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Bathing', 'Bite', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Eating', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Systems', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Improve Access', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Panthera leo', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Sterile coverings', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'aging population', 'assistive robot', 'base', 'care recipients', 'coping', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'haptics', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'intergenerational', 'kinematics', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'preference', 'robot assistance', 'robotic system', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2020,65310,-0.03963900157515122
"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10029357,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,532871,-0.025576015709346575
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10052164,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Child Welfare', 'Cicatrix', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Earthquakes', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Household', 'Imagery', 'Indian Ocean', 'Individual', 'Indonesia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Natural Disasters', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Domains', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Shock', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Sumatra', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Variant', 'Water', 'acetone hydrazone', 'adverse childhood events', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'environmental change', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'human capital', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'member', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'sea level rise', 'success', 'tool', 'weather patterns', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,544239,-0.036571877832941135
"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",10024064,R44ES028656,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Disinfection', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'Wireless Technology', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'empowered', 'graphene', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead concentration', 'lead contamination', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'meetings', 'meter', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'operation', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water quality', 'well water']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2020,719088,-0.0030654486753291656
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise.

"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity. This has the potential to improve management of burn patients and reduce rates of complications.",Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging,10052657,R01GM108634,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Burn Centers', 'Burn injury', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Female', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Injury', 'Laser Speckle Imaging', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ulcer', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'burn model', 'burn wound', 'care costs', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data integrity', 'data modeling', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'healing', 'human data', 'imaging system', 'impression', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'stability testing', 'treatment planning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,430325,-0.025333204747463003
"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10005352,P01DK043881,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2020,1567293,-0.03419860540901227
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,-0.009931055439640563
"Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya Project summary This application is for the fourth, 5-year CoAG between CDC’s Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). Activities take place in western Kenya under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), CDC, and LSTM and benefit from LSTM’s existing infrastructure in Kenya. The research strategy follows the 5 objectives of the NOFO. The first objective involves the expansion in 2020/21 of the epidemiological (1.1) and entomological surveillance (1.2) platform to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets following the introduction of population-wide interventions in 2021/22. To maintain low transmission status, this requires a shift from the existing periodic, district-level surveillance to systems where surveillance itself becomes an intervention and can detect individual geo-located cases near real-time for rapid notification and foci investigation. We will support the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) with their goal to digitise the data collected on their paper-based health registers using software that makes them scannable (1.1.5). This will include registers that capture case-burden data used in out-patient departments (1.1.6) and by community health workers as part of integrated community case management (ICCM) (1.1.7), and antenatal clinic registers that capture malaria infection prevalence during first antenatal clinic visits. This is a novel method to track the asymptomatic parasite reservoir in populations (1.1.8). Combined, this allows, for the first time, sustainable, daily, near real-time surveillance to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets. We will also conduct continuous malaria indicator household surveys (cMIS) to track malaria prevalence and intervention coverage (1.1.9) and entomological monitoring (1.2), both using adaptive sampling frameworks that can respond to challenges related to rapid changes in malaria transmission. As part of the second objective, we will implement population-wide interventions targeting malaria transmission, starting in 2021/22. The optimal combination of novel or improved interventions will be developed in close collaboration with CDC in 2020/21. This is likely to include enhanced case- management using digitally supported quality improvement approaches of ICCM, enhanced vector control with larval source management and insecticide-treated piperonyl butoxide (PBO) nets, and mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and ivermectin targeting the asymptomatic parasite reservoir (2.1). The third objective involves assessing the safety effectiveness of currently deployed antimalarials for the prevention (3.2.1) and treatment (3.2 and 3.3) of malaria in the context of increasing antimalarial drug resistance. We will liaise with CDC’s laboratories in Atlanta for the molecular monitoring of drug resistance. The fourth objective aims to maximise the public health impact by supporting the creation of a knowledge centre at the KEMRI’s CGHR for evidence synthesis and information exchange to enhance the translation of global malaria control policies (4). Objective 5 involves the strengthening of research capacity of the partners in Kenya by the provision of internships (5.1) and MSc, PhD and post-doctoral studentships and research leadership mentoring (5.1). PROJECT NARRATIVE This CoAg supports a collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the US CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support the Kenyan Ministry of Health to achieve major reductions in the malaria burden in areas with intense year-round transmission in western Kenya by 2025. The partnership will support the expansion of the malaria surveillance infrastructure to track the progress towards malaria transmission targets, evaluate different combinations of area-wide interventions targeting the malaria vector and asymptomatic parasite reservoir to reduce malaria transmission and strengthen case management. These activities will provide pivotal critical scientific knowledge to inform and guide malaria program implementation and reduce malaria-associated morbidity and mortality through the identification and scale-up and continued evaluation of evidence-based intervention strategies.",Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya,10126073,U01GH002290,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2020,550000,-0.012006319291822195
"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,9996149,R01NS117058,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Homeobox', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'STN stimulation', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Solid', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'motor deficit', 'motor recovery', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'translation to humans']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,641051,-0.04121254215993351
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact.

"The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives – first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research “Beyond Our Borders,” we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is to accelerate translational science through programs to develop the translational workforce, promote the engagement of community members and other stakeholders, to promote research integration across the lifespan, and to catalyze innovative clinical and translational research. The ongoing development of collaborative data-based infrastructure and services is a central tenant to achieving this mission. The goals of this proposal are: for Iowa to join the N3C partnership, contributing data in an effective method that evolves and improves over time, to enable Iowa researchers to leverage the N3C data resource in their research and to leverage the N3C framework for other areas of research in the future.",The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award,10201104,UL1TR002537,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family Physicians', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Rural Population', 'School Nursing', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfer Agreement', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'community organizations', 'coronavirus disease', 'data acquisition', 'data enclave', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'rurality', 'social determinants', 'support tools', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UL1,2020,98933,-0.022724992718565307
"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center. Research at the Center will analyze state-of-the art data to address fundamental questions regarding fertility, adolescent health, and links between the environment and health.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9899101,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,572773,-0.004389109450115716
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10153499,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2020,511154,-0.03592867187060126
"An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lungfunction variability Executive Summary of Predicate (One Page) Summary of Specific Aims of Phase I Specific Aim 1: Train and evaluate an algorithm to detect pediatric asthma symptoms (cough and wheeze) on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: 90% sensitivity; false alarm rate: 1 cough episode/day or 1 wheeze episode/day. Evaluate algorithm against medical expert (physician) scoring using the two best available asthma scoring tools (AS: asthma score; PRAM: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure). Specific Aim 2: Design and evaluate algorithm to detect lung function variability on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: Using respiratory signals from sensor patch, detect variations ≥ 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Evaluate algorithm against spirometry gold standard. Progress towards Specific Aims As of today, January 21, 2020, the work on the predicate NIH STTR award has not yet begun. The work related to this NIH STTR is anticipated to begin April 2020. Prior to submitting our NIH STTR application, significant work was completed to test the viability of collecting lung function using our wearable technology. We tested on over 20 patients in the hospital, and in this study we found a positive correlation between our measurements and those of spirometry. Our NIH STTR work will build upon this. Technical, administrative, or commercial challenges and how they’ve been addressed During our customer discovery so far, we have learned about the complexities of achieving reimbursement, even if we have identified applicable CPT codes. Realizing this challenge, we selected an initial customer that will not require reimbursement. Our initial customer will be respiratory clinical trials. From our interviews, we have learned that they have a strong unmet need, they are willing to pay a large amount, and we will be able to serve them earlier than other customer types. We hope to explore this further during this NIH I-Corps program.

"Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults in Pennsylvania 1 Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence  2 and prevalence are increasing in this age group. However, due to limitations of traditional surveillance  3 strategies, it remains unknown whether these increases are in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Electronic health  4 record (EHR)-based surveillance is a relatively simple, sustainable, and timely alternative to more traditional  5 methods. Recognizing the attributes of EHR-based surveillance, the Centers for Disease Control and  6 Prevention (CDC) has funded efforts to develop, evaluate, and deploy EHR-based surveillance of diabetes,  7 including the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study and the Diabetes in Young Adults (DiYA) Study.  8 However, the geographic coverage of these studies has been limited. The geographical gaps in these studies  9 are problematic, as there are known geographic disparities in diabetes prevalence and incidence. Moreover, 10 little is known about how the methods applied in these studies will perform in other regions of the country, in 11 rural communities, and in other health systems. The proposed study will use more than two decades of EHR 12 data and administrative claims data to develop and implement EHR-based surveillance of type 1 and type 2 13 diabetes among young adults in a large region of Pennsylvania, the state with the 5th highest prevalence of 14 diabetes in this age group. This information is essential to informing public health strategies, assessing disease 15 burden, and prioritizing type-specific health services. We will use EHR data from Geisinger, a health system 16 serving a large and diverse region of Pennsylvania, to expand the geography of existing surveillance of 17 diabetes subtypes in young adults to the Middle Atlantic, an area without prior EHR-based diabetes 18 surveillance estimates. This region includes a combination of rural and urban communities, enabling us to 19 evaluate differences in the performance of EHR-based algorithms for case ascertainment by community type. 20 In the first phase of the study, we will evaluate the validity; simplicity; and consistency of EHR-based 21 algorithms for identifying diabetes subtypes. This work will build on previously developed algorithms from the 22 SEARCH and DiYA studies. We will use manual review of clinician notes as the gold standard to determine the 23 positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of these algorithms. We propose to use an innovative, 24 efficient, and rigorous validation approach that incorporates natural language processing of clinician notes. We 25 will use a secondary data source, administrative claims data, to assess data completeness and our ability to 26 distinguish between incident and prevalent cases. In the second phase, we will use the best performing 27 algorithms to report on the annual incidence and prevalence of diabetes, by type, in young adults, between 28 2014 and 2024 in 38 Pennsylvania counties. All analyses will be stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance 29 status, and community type (rural/urban). Finally, we will coordinate with CDC and other sites to conduct joint 30 analyses of aggregated data, greatly expanding the population under study. Narrative Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence and prevalence estimates in this age group have been increasing. However, due to limitations of traditional surveillance strategies, it remains unknown whether these increases are in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The proposed research will coordinate, develop, implement, and validate electronic-record based surveillance of diabetes in young adults, by subtype, to inform type-specific public health responses, assess disease burden, and identify priorities for type-specific health services.",Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults in Pennsylvania,10085078,U18DP006509,[' '],NCCDPHP,GEISINGER CLINIC,U18,2020,249631,-0.031913388750100954

"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,10002297,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,284005,-0.03029700193612114
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. The presence of malarial retinopathy can provide additional insight and improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional) R&R Other Project Information 7. Project Summary/Abstract Neurobiological changes caused by addiction impair behavioral control and increase relapse risk (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016), substantiating the need for long-term care coordination and recovery engagement for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) (Humphreys, Malenka, Knutson, & MacCoun, 2017). Because addiction creates stress and reward system dysregulation impairing emotional regulation and executive functioning capacities when experiencing intense craving (Volkow, Koob & McLellan, 2016), traditional didactic relapse prevention strategies may have limited efficacy for those in early recovery when they transition back to their natural communities’ post-discharge from treatment, where they will be exposed to SUD-related stimuli. New recovery support models that detect implicit cue-induced neurophysiological dysregulation and restore real-time regulatory capacity to decrease relapse risk are of clinical significance. ​This feasibility Phase I study will use Virtual Reality (VR) technology to 1) simulate a patient-specific drug cue-triggering experience (VR_drug) to calibrate a personalized neurophysiological relapse risk set-point, captured in-session using fNIRS (​Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy​) sensors, a portable alternative to fMRI which will be integrated into the VR HMD (Head Mounted Display),​ and physiological sensors (smartwatch Empatica E4) worn during the VR_drug scenario ​(Aim 1); ​and 2) simulate a recovery-regulation experience (VR_recovery) using patient-specific virtually-generated sober-supportive relationships, recovery-enhanced environmental conditions, and recovery-associated sensory cues, to calibrate a recovery-regulated neurophysiological set-point, captured by the same in-session neurophysiological sensors systems ​(Aim 2)​. If successful, in Phase II, a mobile recovery support system product will be developed to help individuals in SUD recovery modulate real-time craving by monitoring their personalized neurophysiological relapse risk and activating their recovery-regulation intervention (VR_recovery) to alter urge reactivity in real-time. This type of mobile intervention that is immediately available to individuals in recovery as they leave treatment institutions and transition back into their natural communities may help manage in-the-moment drug urges in ways that allow engagement in other recovery-related activities (e.g., calling a sponsor, getting to a meeting), decreasing real-time relapse risk (Matto,& Seshaiyer, 2018; Matto, 2015; Matto, et al, 2014). R&R Other Project Information 8. Project Narrative Addiction is a self-regulation disorder where chronic exposure to and compulsive consumption of the drug creates dysregulation in the reward, stress and executive functioning regions of the brain, intensifying emotional reactivity and impairing cognitive and behavioral control (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016). This study seeks to examine the utility of using Virtual Reality (VR) simulations to calibrate person-specific neurophysiological relapse-risk and recovery regulation set-points. Results may lead to the development of a non-pharmacological mobile recovery support system to help individuals in SUD recovery manage implicit craving reactivity in ways that reduce relapse risk.",Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional),9898050,R41DA050225,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Conscious', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Euphoria', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Feeds', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Care', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'care coordination', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'head mounted display', 'implicit memory', 'meetings', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 study', 'portability', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'smart watch', 'sobriety', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulation']",NIDA,"BRIGHTLINE INTERACTIVE, LLC",R41,2020,218097,-0.03455961293020407
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions.

"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium.

"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,-0.04216630430511692

"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9964623,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2020,688185,-0.027905331059844822
"Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries Project Summary: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. Advancing a tool such as an electrode, injection pipette or optical fiber through a small hole in the cranium, sometimes over long distances, and placing it precisely in a particular brain area, often much less than one millimeter in diameter, is a significant experimental challenge. Any time an investigator misses the target brain area and the experiment fails as a result, a significant amount of work is lost, additional animals get sacrificed, materials are wasted, and the pace of scientific discovery has been slowed. Even in cases when experiments succeed, they can be difficult to reproduce because many research groups rely on their most experienced lab members and their “special touch” to perform these procedures – thereby adding an element of non- quantitativeness to the procedures, effectively making the experiment less reproducible. We propose to develop a novel stereotaxic apparatus which will overcome many of these shortcomings. Our device features a radically different mechanical design which is natively compatible with both traditional and novel in-vivo techniques. We propose to combine computer 3D vision and robotics for automatic and software guided adjustments of the animal's skull. Landmarks are measured with 3D vision, based on structured illumination at a level of accuracy that has not been accomplished by any of the existing devices. This information will guide a robotic platform to position the animal for the experiment. Finally, we propose to develop an open software platform for neuronavigation that will allow investigators to use the platform with any small animal species they desire to use. Brain atlas systems for neuronavigation can either be downloaded from a cloud based site, or produced de-novo by the investigator by preparing a single set of MRI and CT scans from one sample animal. Our device will help make stereotaxic procedures more accurate and less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Narrative: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. These devices will help make stereotaxic procedures less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Most importantly, they will help reduce or eliminate failed experiments due to mistargeted interventions, thereby accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.",Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries,10080673,R41NS119079,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Monitor', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age group', 'base', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'brain tissue', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cranium', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic strain', 'hexapod', 'in vivo', 'laboratory experience', 'member', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'operation', 'optical fiber', 'programs', 'prototype', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wasting']",NINDS,POPNEURON LTD.,R41,2020,251960,-0.015169238317177435
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9858205,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2020,2217090,-0.02569291431834261
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,-0.002683533547091041
"Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (N3C Supplement) PROJECT SUMMARY Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Tufts CTSI) is based on the conviction that authentic involvement of the entire spectrum of clinical and translational research (CTR) is critical to fulfilling the promise of biomedical science for meeting the public's needs. This includes not only from translation from bench to bedside (T1 translation), but also, crucially for having health impact, translation into effective clinical practice (T2), care delivery and public health (T3), and health policy (T4). Advances on all of these fronts is increasingly dependent on making effective use of scientific data from multiple domains. The COVID-19 global emergency presents both an immediate challenge and an opportunity to progress on important data sharing aims emphasized by NIH. In response, NCATS and the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, and other partnering organizations have committed to developing a next-generation repository for clinical data related to COVID-19, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), as a means of accelerating global research into the disease and aiding the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. The N3C initiative's goal of improving the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with clinical data is consistent with the primary informatics objectives of Tufts CTSI, which am to reduce barriers to the integration of healthcare and research by providing innovative systems, data repositories, and analytical tools, and by enabling greater exchange and collaboration through interoperability, standardization, and resource sharing. In- line with shared objectives, in this supplement we seek to contribute to the N3C initiative as a data provider and thought partner through the following specific aims: (1) continue to play an important role providing tools and resources for N3C's analytics platform; and (2) ensure Tufts CTSI's Informatics Program has sufficient staff and technical resources to continue to provide COVID-specific patient data from our hub to the N3C repository. PROJECT NARRATIVE An integrated, continuously updated data repository and a platform of putting powerful analytics capabilities at the disposal of the scientific community can generate insights into COVID-19 and accelerate the development of effective treatments and vaccines to counter the disease.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,-0.020695648618642887

"Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems Project Summary  Anatomically validated musculoskeletal models of human limbs computed faster than real-time are tools that will help advance the control of neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation, and the study of motor control principles. However, the current state-of-the-art models cannot be both accurate and fast. We propose to develop a new generation of validated real-time human leg models with musculoskeletal dynamics that are robust over the full range of multidimensional motion. The first aim is to validate a lower-limb model in the full range of static postures. The second aim is to validate a lower-limb model during dynamic locomotor tasks.  Building on our previous work, we will use OpenSim model repository as a starting point for the iterative process of validating the muscle anatomy and function using published anatomical data. We expect to recreate the full range of leg postures with the validated model. We will then collect data during locomotor tasks performed by healthy humans on the split-belt treadmill with simultaneous re- cordings of ground reaction forces, full-body motion capture, and surface electromyography from rep- resentative leg muscles. The model will be validated over a rich experimental dataset for locomotor pat- terns required in asymmetric stepping on a self-paced treadmill. We expect to validate the dynamic model by estimating in real-time the observed full body kinematics from muscle activity and ground reaction forces. The inverse solutions will allow us to estimate the ongoing spatiotemporal patterns of muscle activity.  At the conclusion of this study we will develop the detailed lower-limb model with high-di- mensional robust muscle path simulations to predict limb motion in real-time. The outcomes of this proposal will inform future work on the use of the real-time musculoskeletal models for the develop- ment of augmentation devices and the clinical assessment of locomotor deficits. Project Narrative The significance of this project is that it will address the major challenges in achieving intuitive human-computer interactions by allowing the simulation of high-dimensional muscle dynamics in real-time. The main innovation of this proposal is the rigorous validation of human leg model across large anthropomorphic variations (due to age and sex) and the robust performance using novel method for musculoskeletal simulations.",Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems,9979392,R03HD099426,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biomimetics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Neuromechanics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical therapy', 'Polynomial Models', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'computer human interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'locomotor deficit', 'locomotor tasks', 'model development', 'motor control', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'sex', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treadmill']",NICHD,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,76000,-0.03024378381574691

"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure.

"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9925236,R01HD094772,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Artificial Leg', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Degree program', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Environment', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematical Model Simulation', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'powered prosthesis', 'programs', 'prosthesis control', 'rehabilitation research', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'success', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,446707,0.003406462629834729
"Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology Abstract  In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state- of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Although results were promising, the majority of participants still did not meet national guidelines for PA. In the ongoing renewal of R01CA159954, we will randomize 300 Latina women to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention).  The proposed supplement seeks to become the first trial to examine longitudinal patterns of PA adoption and maintenance across a series of longitudinal studies among Latinas. Traditional analytic methods would compare findings across studies and would estimate intervention effects at end of treatment controlling for baseline. We propose to use Integrative Data Analysis to combine data across studies and Latent Class Models to identifies patterns of PA adoption and maintenance. By using Latent Class Modeling (LCM), we will make full use of the longitudinal profile of PA data to identify patterns of change over time. LCMs use objective data (rather than a priori hypotheses) to subdivide the population into distinct groups of participants with similar profiles (of PA changes in this case). LCM can not only capture between- and within-subject heterogeneity, but can aid in the identification of meaningful subgroups within the population. By using this innovative method, we will not only reveal the inter-variability of PA over time but also elucidate the associations between such patterns and key psychosocial, behavioral and demographic predictors. Project Narrative Latinas exhibit high rates of inactivity and related chronic health conditions (including some cancers, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and are therefore in need of culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity interventions. The proposed supplement will build on the aims of the parent and renewal studies by using integrative data analysis to identify patterns of change in objectively measured physical activity over time, and test how these patterns relate to participant-level characteristics, including demographics, psychosocial and physiological predictors.",Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology,9764734,R01CA159954,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Endometrial', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latina', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'burden of illness', 'cancer risk', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'exercise intervention', 'group intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'post intervention', 'protective effect', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social culture', 'success', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigorous intensity']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,216895,-0.021429155408046106
"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities.

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9977179,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,653880,-0.01236322636247755
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,-0.06907879516109472
"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10034533,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured form', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analog', 'animal safety', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'commercialization', 'conditioning', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional functioning', 'first-in-human', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'nanofabrication', 'neural circuit', 'neurotechnology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety testing', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trigonometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,885873,-0.04014868089576092
"Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates Summary/Abstract Each year, about 5-18% of babies are born preterm, accounting for over 0.5M births in the US and 15M globally. Many of these babies are admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) where the medical staff generally have the option of using either invasive arterial lines (IALs) or inflatable-cuff non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. The former introduces the risk of infection, tissue and nerve damage, and the latter is less accurate, especially for hypotensive infants, and may add the risk of ischemic and nerve damage upon repeated measurement. There is a clear need for a safer, continuous, and cost effective form of NIBP measurement to meet the challenge of managing unhealthy blood pressures for neonates. PyrAmes Inc. has developed a novel capacitive sensor technology that is paper thin and flexible and can accurately detect blood pressure (BP). This sensor technology is part of a unique continuous BP monitoring platform that provides accurate, lightweight and comfortable BP monitoring in a wireless, wrist-worn package that is easy to use. The system uses lightweight neural networks to analyze pulse waveform data to provide continuous determination of systolic, diastolic, and mean BP, heart rate, and their variabilities. The sensor is easy to apply non-invasively and records pulsatile data similar to an arterial line, while avoiding the difficulties of placing and maintaining an arterial line. This device can provide gold standard BP monitoring without perturbing the patients for more accurate and relevant measurements. The objective of this project is to extend the platform for use with term and pre-term neonates. This goal will be accomplished through redesign of the sensor hardware and optimization of the data analytics software. We will validate these modifications with clinical data from the NICU at Stanford University Medical Center. In Phase I, we will miniaturize the electronics and modify the sensor array of a wrist-worn pulse wave monitor to be sized more appropriately for neonates. We will validate the new device design by collecting NICU clinical data from patients who have IALs in place in an IRB-approved study. From IAL and sensor data taken simultaneously, we will determine ground truth values on a pulse-by-pulse basis and use these data in conjunction with additional IAL data from historical databases to improve our sensor quality and predictive BP models. Our success metric will be to equal or exceed the quality and accuracy of our data for adults. Phase II will be a follow-up IRB-approved pivotal study using the device from Phase 1 to position our device for FDA submission and clearance and scale up to pilot production of this device. Project Narrative The goal of this Phase 1 project is to confirm that machine learning can be used to extract blood pressure values for critically ill neonates from pulse waveform data collected with a wearable, non-invasive device that is comfortable, low-cost and easy to use. The proposed device will significantly reduce the need for frequent cuff-based measurements and/or invasive arterial lines, thereby decreasing morbidity, risk of complications, patient discomfort, and overall cost of care. This project is based on the pioneering efforts of Prof. Zhenan Bao’s lab at Stanford on thin film sensors for electronic skin and includes the design and use of a miniaturized device to collect clinical data from neonates that will be used to validate a model which derives blood pressure values from the pulse waveform without external calibration.",Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates,9910153,R43HD101175,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Area', 'Arterial Lines', 'Birth', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood pressure determination', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Coin', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronics', 'Female', 'Film', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Nerve', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Pain', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'encryption', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'light weight', 'male', 'miniaturize', 'neonate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pressure', 'preterm newborn', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'success', 'tonometry']",NICHD,"PYRAMES, INC.",R43,2020,224556,-0.0024114034819008013
"Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) PROJECT SUMMARY Medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that can leach and cause acute contact dermatitis (ACD) after repeated exposure or prolonged contact of the skin to these toxins. ACD is credited for 10-15% of all occupational illnesses and is also the second highest reported occupational hazard. Given its prevalence, ACD is also a great public health burden with combined yearly costs of up to $1 billion, which spans including medical costs, worker’s compensation and lost working time due to workplace absence. To this end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated that all medical devices must be evaluated for possible skin sensitization using in vivo animal assays, which includes the Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Although GPMT tests provide valuable data on the skin sensitization effects of potential toxins, these assays are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) recently published a Strategic Roadmap, calling for the development of alternative approaches to reduce animal testing of chemical and medical agents. Thus, there is a stated need to modernize safety evaluation of medical devices to reduce animal testing and shorten the regulatory review time, which would ultimately bring safer devices to the market faster. To address this unmet need, the key objectives of our FDA Phase I SBIR project are to (i) produce rigorously validated computational models for the GPMT assay integrating data obtained in human, mouse, and in vitro assays; and (ii) integrate these models into a software product termed PreSS/MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices). Our specific aims for this study include: 1) collecting, curating, and integrating the largest publicly available dataset for GMPT; 2) creating and validating novel computational models for GMPT data; 3) developing the PreSS/MD web server to allow users to make predictions of skin sensitization potential in medical devices. We will also develop a model for mixtures, including compounds tested jointly in different concentrations, using an approach that we developed previously. Finally, we will implement novel approaches to help users of our PreSS/MD platform interpret the developed models in terms of key chemical features responsible for skin sensitization. In addition, we will employ biomedical knowledge graphs to elucidate Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for skin sensitizers. Successful execution of this Phase I project will yield in the development of PreSS/MD as a centralized resource to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices. We expect this software-as-a-service web server platform will be of great value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis, the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all devices be evaluated for possible skin sensitization effects using in vivo assays such as the Guinea pig maximization test. In the effort to modernize skin sensitization safety evaluation methods to reduce in vivo animal testing, herein we propose to develop a software product, PreSS/-MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization caused by Medical Devices), as an innovative and unique in silico alternative with the potential to better predict human response compared to the existing approaches for skin sensitization assessment. Successful execution of the objectives described in this project will result in a centralized web server platform to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices, which will be of significant value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices.",Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD),10079701,R43ES032371,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Allergic Contact Dermatitis', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cavia', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Contact Dermatitis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Instruction', 'Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Prevalence', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Workers&apos', ' Compensation', 'Workplace', 'adverse outcome', 'chemical release', 'cost', 'experience', 'in silico', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lymph nodes', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'occupational hazard', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'response', 'skin patch', 'software as a service', 'success', 'systemic toxicity', 'tool', 'web portal', 'web server']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R43,2020,167910,-0.013730492311167944
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9732635,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'pedometer', 'physical model', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,183406,-0.004374956022238411
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10085550,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2020,1387605,-0.027573407796536827
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases Project Summary/Abstract Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of- care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage. A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.  A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation, plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting humans of all ages, including infants.  In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable vascular imaging metrics.  In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings of the world. Project Narrative Vascular diseases are becoming epidemic with increase in aging population, obesity and type II diabetes. They affect humans of all age groups, including neonates.

"Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions Project Summary  The goal of this project is to further develop an existing smart stethoscope in order to be capable of monitoring pediatric patients at home who suffer from asthma as well as adults with COPD. Lung diseases impose a serious burden on healthcare systems, individuals and governments. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) ranked third and fourth as the leading causes of death in 2016, each claiming 3 million lives annually. LRIs accounted for 14.9% of pediatric deaths, making it the leading cause of infant mortality after pre-term birth. Asthma—a condition for which, like COPD, there is no cure—is also the leading chronic disease in children and an estimated 235 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, with over 380,000 deaths from the disease in 2015. Asthma and COPD costed the United States approximately $56 billion and $72 billion last year, respectively. The burden of these diseases and the health disparities across populations is only slated to get worse in the coming decade, as respiratory diseases are expected to increase by 155% due to an aging population and increased pollution, while there is expected to a large shortage of pulmonary specialists, with an expect 7% decline by 2030.  We reasoned that a long-term monitoring solution that can be used in the home by untrained patients, or family members of patients, that could detect and monitor severity of airway inflammation in patients, provide insight into reasons for worsening or improved symptoms, push tailored educational content, and direct patients to medical follow before the situation becomes acute, would empower patients with chronic conditions while also reducing trips to emergency departments and readmission rates to hospitals. We find that several challenges exist when considering long term auscultatory monitoring solutions in non-traditional clinical settings: (1) unpredictable ambient noise, (2) the need for medical expertise to interpret lung sounds, (3) subjectivity in the analysis, and (4) difficulty using and placing the stethoscope. The research team developed a smart stethoscope that was originally intended for use in low-resource countries by community health workers to differentiate between pediatric patients with crackles and wheezes that overcomes many of these challenges. This smart stethoscope address all the challenges above by including (1) adaptive noise suppression that has been objectively and subjectively proven to be superior in all types of noise environments than traditional or other electronic stethoscopes, (2) on-board analysis algorithms that can detect crackles and wheezes in pediatric patients with an accuracy that matches that of a specialist, and (3) a uniform pickup surface that removes the requirement for exact placement of the device to get an accurate recording. In this project, we will validate that the device can be correctly used by parents of children with asthma and accurate recordings can be taken that are similar in quality to those that would be taken by a medical professional. Simultaneously, we will be using patient feedback to iterate on the device and mobile app design to create a version that patients are comfortable using in their home. Once the device and app have been validated in Phase I, we plan to move into directly into Phase II where the device will enter in a second phase of investigation that will include a first-time longitudinal study from parents of pediatric patients taking daily recordings in their home. This data will then be used for the development of algorithms to determine lung sound severities with metrics that can be tracked and predicted over time. In parallel to the this clinical study and algorithm development, recordings will be taken of adult patients with COPD to expand the usability of the device beyond pediatrics. Project Narrative This proposal aims to validate a smart auscultation device for home use and develop algorithms that can track changes in, and severity of, lung sounds in order to monitor patients over long periods of time, improve the clinical relevance of home monitoring for timely interventions, and decrease hospital admissions. Current state of the art technology available to patients suffering from asthma and COPD is unable to intelligently monitor patients at home and no long-term monitoring solutions exist for these conditions, resulting in increases in emergency department visits. The academic partner has developed a smart stethoscope that offers greatly improved audio fidelity in any type of noise environment, automated on-board analysis and detection algorithms of lung sounds, and increased ease of use. The small business partner is in the process of commercializing the device for clinical use by trained, professional personnel. Together, we are aiming to test whether the device can be reliably used by non-trained personnel for home use, develop algorithms that would provide metrics for monitoring trends and severities of lung sounds and predict future severity, expand the current abilities of the stethoscope from pediatrics to all patients, and transfer this technology to the small business partner for further clinical testing and commercial development such that it can improve the long-term outcome for patients with chronic lung conditions.",Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions,9909859,R42HL147728,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auditory', 'Auscultation', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Community Health Aides', 'Cost of Illness', 'Country', 'Crackles', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Stethoscopes', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untrained Personnel', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'aging population', 'airway inflammation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy trial', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'pediatric patients', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatic improvement', 'trend', 'usability']",NHLBI,"SONAVI LABS, INC.",R42,2020,236489,-0.0943951834627143
