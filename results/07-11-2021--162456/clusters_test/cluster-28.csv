"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,10102280,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38161
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,10194380,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38222
"Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY In the healthy brain, white matter connections coordinate the speed and reliability of communication among spatially distributed regions. The transmission of neural information with fine temporal precision is crucial for executive function (EF), defined as the coordination of attention, memory, and inhibitory control for goal-directed actions crucial for survival, health, and well-being. Notably, EF undergoes protracted development throughout youth, and the development of executive deficits is present in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and ADHD. However, the degree to which transdiagnostic executive deficits arise due to abnormal development of white matter networks remains unknown. Existing neuroimaging studies of transdiagnostic executive deficits have been limited by 1) inadequate methods to assess neurodevelopmental patterns of spatially distributed brain regions, and 2) inadequate theories of neural communication at the level of macro-scale structural networks. Here we address the latter challenge by generalizing long-established theoretical principles and empirical observations of efficient neurotransmission at the microscale neuron level to the macroscale structural connectome by calculating transmission fidelity. Transmission fidelity models how efficiently a brain region embedded in the structural network can transmit messages to a target region with individually differing speed and reliability. Moreover, we address the former challenge by capitalizing on advances in network science and machine learning. Utilizing these methods is a promising direction for investigating abnormal brain development. In this proposal, we describe the application of a novel analysis of structural network maturation to study the manifestation of transdiagnostic executive deficits. Using a large sample of youth who completed cross-sectional neuroimaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=1,042), our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structural connectivity and EF across age. We will use an additional cross-sectional dataset enriched with youths presenting with psychopathology acquired through the Healthy Brain Network study (n=5,000) to generalize our findings to executive dysfunction. To quantify developmental norms, we will capitalize on our large-scale datasets to train a machine learning model that predicts expected ranges of healthy brain development. Furthermore, understanding within-person changes in brain structure and EF necessitates longitudinal data. We will longitudinally assess youths diagnosed with ADHD (n=50) or schizophrenia (n=50), and typically developing comparators (n=40). In this proposal, we aim to 1) delineate how age-related variation of brain network transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders, and 2) determine how within-individual development in transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction in ADHD and the psychosis spectrum. A better understanding of atypical inter-individual and within-individual developmental patterns of brain networks provides a framework towards precision medicine in neuropsychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individualized therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how developmental deviations from expected norms of brain maturation manifest as psychopathology. We propose to apply a novel method based on network science and machine learning to provide a new perspective on the brain’s developmental patterns that can manifest as executive deficits that span psychopathology. To delineate the typical and atypical development of executive function, we will develop a quantification of within-person longitudinal patterns of brain network maturation contextualized in predictions of developmental norms from unique large-scale neuroimaging datasets of youth.",Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology,10233459,F31MH126569,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Population Study', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'executive function', 'individualized medicine', 'inter-individual variation', 'large scale data', 'mental development', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'transmission process', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Machine learning for brain and epigenetic aging in neurodegenerative diseases Project Summary/Abstract Accurate quantiﬁcation of aging for different organ systems enables detection of any deviation from typical aging and identiﬁcation of early onset of a disease characterized by accelerated aging, and thus provides opportunities for early intervention. The brain-Predicted Age Difference (brainPAD) is a new clinical informatics framework deﬁned as the difference between the brain-derived age and the chronological age of the individual. It has been suggested that brainPAD correlates with physical ﬁtness, cognitive performance, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, several limitations remain in current brainPAD models. Models with large age range yield prediction error larger than 5 years and are often derived from a single-modal imaging feature set (e.g. only structural data). Moreover, due to known inﬂuence of sex differences on brain morphology, existing models are trained on male and female separately, which may pose challenges in studies with small sample size and in interpretation across models. Finally, because of the phenomenon of regression to the mean, predicted age is overestimated in younger individuals and underestimated in older, which can lead to false positive associations of brainPAD with variables of interest, such as disease status.  To address these limitations, this proposal aims to develop and apply novel machine learning algorithms and biomedical software to increase the model accuracy and robustness in three Speciﬁc Aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a novel feature selection method to identify brain features inﬂuencing brainPAD; 2) Apply the novel machine learning framework to explore different data types and feature types provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); 3) Develop and validate integrative methods to create new measures of clinically abnormal aging and compute these measures on the ADNI longitudinal data. Addressing the existing bias and accounting for confounding effects, the new and more accurate measures of a person's age from their brain and epigenetic signatures will provide insights into what causes atypical aging and help predict the onset and individual trajectory of progression in speciﬁc neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Project Narrative The ability to objectively quantify the degree of aging for different organ systems is central to identifying underly- ing biological mechanisms of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.

"Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning Project Summary/Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies shows mounting evidence that neurodegenerative diseases manifest distinct network dysfunction patterns much earlier prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Since the subject-specific longitudinal network changes are more relevant to the neuropathological process than topological patterns derived from cross-sectional data, recognizing the subtle and dynamic longitudinal network biomarkers from noisy network data is of great demand to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of computer-assisted diagnosis in neurodegenerative diseases. However, current popular statistical inference or machine learning approaches used for neuroimages (in a regular data structure such as grid and lattice) are not fully optimized for the learning task on brain network data which is often encoded in a high dimensional graph (an irregular and non-linear data structure). Such gross adaption is partially responsible for the lack of reliable biomarkers that can be used to predict cognitive decline in routine clinical practice. To address this challenge, we aim to (1) develop a novel GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to hierarchically discover the multi-scale network biomarkers that can recognize the disease-relevant network alterations over time, and (2) examine the diagnostic power of the new network biomarkers derived from our GNN-based machine learning engine across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia. The success of this project will allow us to integrate the novel GNN-based learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis toolbox and release the AI (artificial intelligence) based network analysis software to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to continue the tool development of longitudinal network analysis for neurodegenerative diseases with the focus on the machine learning component. To do so, we will first develop the GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to discover the multi-scale network biomarkers from the population of brain network data. After examining the diagnostic value of the network biomarkers discovered by our learning- based method across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia, we will integrate the machine learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis software and release to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community.",Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning,10109509,R03AG070701,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'collaboratory', 'comparison group', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'network dysfunction', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2021,158733
"Development of neurologic itch signature Abstract: Chronic itch is a global health problem affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. However, there is no objective biomarker to assess itch. Since itch results from activity in brain circuits through the participation of many brain regions, we suggest developing specific brain biomarkers to assess the disease states and treatment effects using functional brain imaging and machine learning. Developments of biomarkers are one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. In itch treatment, assessment of itch is an important indicator in understanding the progress of chronic itch and treatment effect. Currently, itch assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self-reports, which is inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological pruriceptive (itch-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of itch. In particular, self-report is not applicable for people who have a limited capacity to report itch such as infants, very young children, and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Addressing chronic itch is becoming a central morbidity in many dermatological diseases and a primary endpoint in clinical trials. Therefore, there is a great need to develop a reliable biomarker for itch. Itch-related neural signals are a fundamental element of the itch sensation. Measuring these signals can be a reliable biomarker for itch. Recent advancement of brain imaging combined with machine learning algorithms has enabled development of brain activity-based biomarkers to assess various mental activities and brain functions. This advancement, together with ongoing progress of low- cost & high-performance MRI, will expand the feasibility of practical use of fMRI in medicine. A brain activity- based biomarker for itch (i.e., Neurologic Itch Signature, NIS) may dramatically improve the quality of diagnoses, treatments and clinical trials. Moreover, the NIS can be a promising biomarker for itch-related processing in the brain, which enables to better understand the pathophysiology of chronic itch. The aim of our research proposal is to develop the NIS. In particular, we will demonstrate (1) that the NIS will selectively respond to itch (i.e., unresponsive to pain) and (2) that the NIS can predict not only an existence of itch but also itch intensity, as these are fundamental requirements of biomarker for itch. To achieve this goal, we will obtain datasets of brain activity during various intensities of itch and pain stimuli and resting condition by using functional MRI (fMRI), and identify a characteristic brain activity pattern for itch (i.e., the NIS) by analyzing the datasets using a machine learning algorithm. We will test whether the created NIS can predict itch and severity of itch without prior information. The NIS will accelerate itch research and improve quality of diagnosis and treatment of itch, which will eventually help the many people who suffer from chronic itch. Relevant statement Our proposal is the first project to develop a brain activity-based biomarker for itch. Success of our proposal will eventually allow us to share an objective itch assessment using the biomarker with research institutes, hospitals and industries across the world to accelerate itch research, and improve diagnosis and assessment of itch treatment.",Development of neurologic itch signature,10193704,R21AR078940,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antipruritics', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Dermatologic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pruritus', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'chronic itch', 'cost', 'diagnosis quality', 'expectation', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurotransmission', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'phrases', 'primary endpoint', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,174695
"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD.

"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548
"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic- ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time- dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics; and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients surviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We aim to reduce secondary brain injury and neurological disability from seizures after cardiac arrest by personalizing seizure treatment using EEG and brain MRI biomarkers of neuro-recovery. We expect that the outcome of the proposed studies will provide critical knowledge about epileptogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury andguide the development of goal-directed seizure treatment and patient selection in future clinical trials.",Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest,10105883,K23NS119794,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'American', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention Trial', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Propofol', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resuscitation', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomarker-driven', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural hypothermia', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological recovery', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'resilience', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,191538
"Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Converging evidence has linked the habenula (Hb), a small epithalamic structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling, to a wide range of affective, motivational, and motor functions. Abnormalities in Hb circuitry are increasingly implicated in psychiatric and behavioral disorders. In vivo Hb research has proceeded slowly, however, due to technical constraints in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that make it difficult to define and characterize this small region. Understanding of the Hb is especially limited in adolescence, a critical period marked by rapid maturation of the reward system and, often, the first emergence of psychiatric disorders. To address these gaps in basic and clinical neuroscience, our proposal leverages the unprecedented scale and quality of high-resolution neuroimaging data available through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the development of Hb function in early adolescence and its role in psychiatric illness onset. The proposed research builds on extensive work by our group to develop and refine Hb imaging methodology, including automated segmentation and a region of interest optimization approach that significantly improves Hb fMRI sensitivity, and is supported by substantial data from our laboratory. In independent samples of adult and adolescent healthy controls (HCs), we found a highly consistent pattern of positive Hb intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), downstream nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cortical salience network (SN), as well as negative Hb iFC throughout the default mode network (DMN). Adults with high vs. low subclinical depression scores exhibited distinct iFC patterns with regions associated with anxiety and depression, including the amygdala and insula. Moreover, adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders had positive Hb iFC with the DMN, and this abnormal Hb-DMN iFC pattern was associated with anxiety severity across both healthy and clinical adolescents, while hyperconnectivity with SN and other expected Hb targets correlated with anhedonia. Building on our compelling findings to date, we propose to study Hb function at Baseline and Year 2 ABCD neuroimaging timepoints in relation to normative (Aim 1) and clinical (Aim 2) developmental trajectories. Subjects will comprise two cohorts of ~3000 adolescents each: clinical subjects, with significant past or current mood and anxiety symptoms, and HCs, with no history of psychiatric diagnoses or clinically significant symptoms. Study procedures will incorporate sophisticated preprocessing and denoising, optimized subject-level Hb definition, neuroanatomically accurate cortical surface mapping, and rigorous non-parametric statistics. Analyses will encompass both resting-state and task fMRI to characterize Hb iFC and activation during specific reward, loss, and inhibitory control processes. We will examine both group differences and associations with psychiatric symptom severity using hypothesis-driven as well as machine learning approaches.  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to advance basic and clinical neuroscientific understanding of the habenula, a small structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling and is increasingly implicated in psychiatric disorders. The technical difficulty of studying the habenula has limited in vivo research, especially in adolescent populations where psychiatric symptoms often first emerge. Using an optimize analysis approach and a large sample of high- resolution neuroimaging data from the ABCD study, we propose to comprehensively investigate habenula function in normative early adolescent development and in the onset and trajectory of adolescent mental illness.",Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study,10234369,R21MH126501,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Health', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epithalamic structure', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habenula', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'animal data', 'anxiety symptoms', 'automated segmentation', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'denoising', 'early adolescence', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'subclinical depression', 'tv watching']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,210000
"Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement.  Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In this proposal, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period.  In an ancillary study to this parent clinical trial, we propose a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This proposal is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. Furthermore, in the first parent trial participant we successfully mapped MDD circuits at the individual level and found that gamma power in the amygdala could successfully decode mood state (AUC = 86%). This proposal builds on these preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The characterization of circuit dynamics underlying mood states in major depression and the acute modifiability of circuit features is an innovative and poorly understood area of research. Using an unparalleled dataset of invasive multi-day neural recordings from 160 contacts in patients with major depression who are taking part in a clinical trial of closed loop deep brain stimulation (PRESDIO trial), we seek to identify a set of neural connectivity and activity features that characterize symptom severity states, and to determine whether circuit features can be acutely modified by brain stimulation. This work has high translational potential for development of novel circuit-based neuromodulation therapies for major depression.",Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression,10104344,R21MH124759,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'comorbid depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,242250
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,10113371,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,380647
"Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting in loss of cognitive and bodily function, and no cure or effective treatment currently exists. While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein aggregation, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and metabolic defects, the exact mechanism of neuronal death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. The goal of this research project is to test whether molecular and cellular dysfunction can be transmitted from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To achieve this goal, we will first map the functional connectivity between regions of brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, observe how these connections change over the progression of the disease, and link these functional changes to behavioral phenotypes in animals. We will then profile levels of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites in tissue from several brain regions in these same mice, and observe whether changes in immunometabolic state coincide in time and space with the functional connections measured by MRI. Successful completion of this work will test a potential mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease spreading through the brain, and provide a map of coupling between immune, metabolic, and functional pathology that could open new directions for future development of early disease diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein build-up, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and faulty metabolism, the exact mechanism of brain cell death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. We propose that the dysfunctional cellular state leading to brain cell death is transferred from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To test this idea, we will map paths of brain activity using neuroimaging in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, measure the corresponding levels of immune markers and metabolic function in each brain region, and then overlay these maps to understand how they correspond over the course of disease. This study combines cutting-edge neuroimaging and molecular assays along with machine learning and computational modeling to test a proposed mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease progression, with the potential to open new directions for pursuit of therapeutic strategies.",Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease,10217616,R21AG068532,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Control Animal', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'awake', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain cell', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'imaging approach', 'interest', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R21,2021,438028
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,10138039,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'detection limit', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,534438
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,10062524,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,553209
"FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening Abstract: Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last two decades mainly through the various modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer (FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more than 44,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 22,000 times. FS is part of the analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), as well as the UK BioBank. One third of the 600+ ADNI-based publications cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS. Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1-weighted MRI images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, as well as EEG/MEG. FS provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.  The original grant mostly centered around Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG). SAMSEG uses parametric Bayesian generative modeling to segment brain images. The SAMSEG framework fits atlas priors and multivariate Gaussian intensity models to brain images (including MRI artifacts such as bias fields). SAMSEG can take any modality or combination of modalities as input. Since it adapts its intensity model, it is robust to differences in scanner. Since it is a generative model, it is easy to extend to encompass more segmentation details. For example, the SAMSEG framework has been used to segment hippocampal subfield, amygdalar nuclei, thalamic nuclei, and extracerebral structures.  The main vision for the renewal is to extend the SAMSEG framework to accommodate longitudinal models, incorporate more anatomical details, and to use SAMSEG output as a basis for cortical surface placement that is, like SAMSEG, modality independent and capable of using any combination of modalities. In addition, we propose a series of new tools that will assist in the individual and group analysis of large studies by creating study-specific models. In addition to this new technical development, we are requesting support for software engineering, maintenance, and user support – mundane and not innovative, but high-impact this type of support is critical to the thousands of researchers who rely on FreeSurfer. Narrative: This work will support the popular FreeSurfer neuroimaging analysis software program used by thousands of researchers world-wide. FreeSurfer uses cutting edge algorithms to automatically extract a host of biomarkers from brain imaging data which can be used for research, pharmaceutical evaluation, and diagnosis. This proposal will allow for continued support of FreeSurfer from the developers as well as new development to make FreeSurfer faster, more robust, and easier to interpret.","FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening",10130964,R01EB023281,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Free Will', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inherited', 'Lesion', 'Leukoaraiosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bone', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human imaging', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555356
"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,10140263,R01AG067420,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'safety testing', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,598015
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data.

"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data. These efforts will increase our understanding of normal human brain circuitry and organization and may ultimately contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.",Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex,10132393,R01MH060974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Callithrix', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injections', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'anatomical tracing', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'denoising', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,618537
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,10112311,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data repository', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,705172
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,10149410,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,733897
"Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation. A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep- dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents (UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS, but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials. A fundamental challenge to finding effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders is the paucity of biomarkers that can gauge whether a potential intervention affects abnormal circuitry early in the treatment development pipeline, before embarking on expensive and lengthy clinical trials. This research proposal will develop novel physiological assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in humans and rodents that can be used to predict the efficacy of newly emerging treatments. These assays will enable the efficient screening and identification of treatments that can alleviate highly disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation,10112344,UG3MH125273,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Eszopiclone', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rodent', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinical candidate', 'density', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'memory consolidation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'screening', 'sleep spindle', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG3,2021,734247
"Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients Project Summary Primary characteristics of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include persistent fears and excessive maladaptive avoidance behaviors. Preclinical models of PTSD have heavily investigated the brain mechanisms of fear inhibition and active avoidance learning. Significant progress has been made in translating fear conditioning and extinction data into the human brain and their implications have helped further our understanding of PTSD psychopathology. The mechanisms of active avoidance, however, have scarcely been examined in the human brain, especially within the context of maladaptive responses as in the case of PTSD. The studies proposed in this application are designed to begin to fill this scientific gap. We will use a novel conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP) to examine the neural correlates of active avoidance and fear extinction learning and explore how extinction modulates active avoidance responses in participants with and without a PTSD diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). PTSD psychopathology involves dysfunctional limbic-frontal activity including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus (HPC), and amygdala. Studies of avoidance in rodents and a few fMRI studies in healthy humans suggest that the vmPFC and striatum mediate threat response by toggling the expression of fear vs. avoidance responses. Participants (healthy controls with trauma exposure, and patients diagnosed with PTSD) will undergo the novel (validated) two- day CAAP. On day 1, participants will undergo Pavlovian fear conditioning, immediately followed by an active avoidance conditioning phase. Avoidance is achieved by pressing a button to prevent a shock from occurring but will not terminate the conditioned stimulus (CS). Pavlovian fear extinction learning (button removed; no avoidance possible) will follow. On day 2, recall of extinction learning will be tested. Before the start of the recall test, participants will receive a small monetary endowment and will be told that this money could be used to pay for shock avoidance during the recall test. The first aim is to Identify neural correlates of active avoidance. The second aim is to study activations after the CS+ terminates that index the relief from the avoided shock. The third aim is to examine neural correlates of extinction-to-avoidance transfer. The proposed studies are expected to provide a more integrated mechanistic understanding of the psychopathology of PTSD and reduce the gap between the rodent literature and human neuroimaging in avoidance research. Project Narrative The experiments proposed aim to examine the neural mechanisms of active avoidance learning and explore how these mechanisms are modulated by fear extinction learning circuits. We will use a novel conditioning and avoidance paradigm to gather functional MRI and subjective reports data from healthy controls and from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The anticipated impact is to enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive avoidance responses, reduce the translation gap in this area between rodents and human studies, and explore potential novel targets for advancing the treatment of PTSD.",Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients,10211625,R01MH123736,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Endowment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Price', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'learning extinction', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'trauma exposure', 'willingness to pay']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,756037
"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Abstract  Individual differences in brain structure, including cortical morphology and the white matter connectome are associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. The first year of life is a period of rapid and dynamic structural and functional brain development and new data from our cohort suggests that a large portion of individual differences in brain structure in 10 and 12 year olds is already present in the first year or two of life. Early adolescence and puberty is the second major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we propose to follow these children at 12, 14 and 16 years of age. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be performed. Cognitive and behavioral development will be assessed, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. We will determine how adolescent brain development contributes to individual differences in relation to early childhood development and whether the white matter connectome is a useful early imaging biomarker. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, and ultimately inform early intervention strategies that prevent or mitigate risk and illness severity. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding childhood brain development and its relationship to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence, and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative For years it has been hypothesized that psychiatric disorders are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development, though there is little direct evidence to support that hypothesis. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a longitudinal study that has followed children with imaging and developmental assessments from birth to age 10 years. We will study brain structure and function in these children at 12, 14, and 16 years with MRI to see if we can identify childhood predictors of behavior in adolescence that is considered at risk for psychiatric illness, which will ultimately help target periods of childhood development for early intervention.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10206731,R01MH123747,"['10 year old', '12 year old', '16 year old', '4 year old', '8 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Puberty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'adolescent brain development', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain abnormalities', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'executive function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'postnatal period', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'sex', 'social', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,763760
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10216953,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,796409
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis). Changes in frontal-temporal regions/circuitry and neurocognitive measures over time will be examined together using novel approaches (e.g., machine learning) to predict diagnostic group, symptom severity, and functional outcome for the identification of key factors associated with risk and resilience in the SZ spectrum.",Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum,10123002,R01MH121411,"['Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'causal model', 'early onset', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'longitudinal course', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'white matter']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,796941
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,10160747,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,833908
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,10142533,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,843511
"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning Abstract This application will combine the strengths of two large scale NIH-funded initiatives to understand disorder- related patterns in the human brain: Connectomes Related to Human Disease (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA). We will develop and evaluate novel brain vulnerability metrics - based on the idea of polygenic risk scores – that we expect to better predict diagnosis and cognitive performance than standard neuroimaging measures. We define a metric of “vulnerability” by quantifying the similarity between each individual's brain pattern and deficit patterns in neuropsychiatric disorders. The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) uses Big Data meta-analyses to quantify the similarity between an individual and meta-analytical deficit effect size patterns based on large and diverse international samples. The Machine Learning-Vulnerability Index (MVI) is trained using Big Data mega-analytic samples to quantify the similarity for individual brain patterns to those learned from patients and controls. We will compute novel, cross-domain vulnerability metrics to phenotype each of the N=3,350 CHRD individuals across three mainly psychiatric (schizophrenia-spectrum and psychosis disorder, major depression, and bipolar disorder), three mainly neurological (epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease) and three neuroimaging domains (structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI). Our Specific Aims merge CRHD and ENIGMA data to test four hypotheses: 1) Neuropsychiatric illnesses not only impact an isolated region or circuit, but are associated with deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that can be unique to each illness; 2) such deficit patterns are informative of cognitive deficits in patients; 3) similarity with the deficit patterns will have higher specificity and sensitivity than any traditional neuroimaging metric or trait; and 4) similarity at the voxel- and vertex-based level may lead to development of high-resolution vulnerability indices. We will test these hypotheses by performing patient-control sensitivity and specificity analyses in the corresponding CRHD illness groups; study the degree of separation vs. commonality across psychiatric and neurological disorders; and evaluate pattern differences at specific stages of the illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease. We will use multivariate mediation analyses to link vulnerability to variance in cognitive domains ascertained by CHRD. This short, intensive project will benefit the community-at-large by populating the CHRD/HCP database with novel multimodal brain phenotypes extracted and homogenized using standard ENIGMA workflows, enriched with Open Science approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE The Connectomes Related to Human Disease/Human Connectome Project (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) are two large scale NIH-funded initiatives exploring disorder-related patterns in the human brain. The two projects are complementary: CRHD focuses on in-depth, high-resolution multimodal phenotyping of the brain connectome in modest samples, whereas ENIGMA's analyses harness the statistical power of large and inclusive, worldwide samples. We propose combining the strengths of CRHD and ENIGMA to test novel biomarkers based on replicable and consistent illness deficit patterns provided by Big Data studies. We posit that major brain illnesses do not impact an isolated region or brain circuit but rather lead to deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that are shared or unique to an illness; such deficit patterns are highly replicable and linked to severity, duration and treatment resistance. We will develop and evaluate a multivariate vulnerability model based on (1) the degree of similarity between an individual's brain patterns and expected disorder patterns defined as a linear combination of deficits - conceptually similar to polygenic risk scores - and (2) a vulnerability metric computed using machine learning. We will test the specificity and sensitivity of these models against the single most discriminative neuroimaging traits in six diagnostic categories shared by CRHD and ENIGMA: schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) and psychosis, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorders (BP), epilepsy (EP), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will use multivariate analyses to compare sensitivity and specificity of the regional vulnerability index (RVI) and machine learning vulnerability (MVI) in separating patients and controls in the CHRD samples, mapping unique and shared deficit patterns across six diagnostic categories. We will link vulnerability metrics to cognitive outcomes and diagnosis using mediation analyses. Finally, we will enrich vulnerability models with CHRD's connectomics based phenotypes including cortical myelination to advance white matter integrity measurements for future large-scale ENIGMA studies.",Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning,10186960,RF1MH123163,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heritability', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cognitive performance', 'connectome', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'imaging approach', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'open data', 'polygenic risk score', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,RF1,2021,1220179
"Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling The human brain is an unimaginably complicated system of interconnected neurons that is capable of complex thought, emotion and behavior. Macroscale white matter connections quantified via the structural connectome (SC) act as the backbone for the flow of functional activation, which can be represented via the functional con- nectome (FC). Our group and others have shown that quantifying properties of the brain’s structural and func- tional connectomes and their relationship can inform understanding of brain-behavior associations and disease mechanisms4-9. However, models that describe SC-FC relationships have only achieved moderate agreement with observations and have not been used to fully explore the heritability and cognitive implications of structure- function coupling in adult and developing populations. If we do not accurately understand how the brain’s anat- omy and physiology are linked across the human lifespan, then we will not be able to quantify the impact of disease or pathological developmental trajectories. Our long-term goal is to create computational tools for stud- ying the brain’s structure and function, particularly in the context of disease. The overarching objective of this project is to create a model that accurately {and interpretably} quantifies the coupling between the structural and functional connectomes in both sexes, which will in turn allow us to investigate the heritability and cognitive implications of SC-FC coupling across developing and adult populations. Our central hypothesis is that a {hybrid approach to predicting FC from SC, combining both biophysical modeling and deep learning,} will be more ac- curate than existing techniques. Based on the prior literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SC- FC coupling will vary with sex, be heritable, associated with development, and explain inter-subject variability in cognition. Our hypothesis is supported by preliminary data from our group and others that show SC-FC relation- ships are heritable and vary with sex and cognition in patients7,18. The rationale for this work is that having an accurate model of the SC-FC relationship in healthy populations, which currently does not exist, will further our understanding of the complex relationship between anatomy, physiology, sex, genetics and cognition. We will test the central hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) identify the most accurate model for predicting FC from SC, 2) quantify the heritability of SC-FC coupling and its association with cognitive performance and 3) characterize the SC-FC coupling trajectory and its cognitive implications throughout development. We will use neuroimaging, genetic and cognitive data from the Human Connectome Project, including young adult (~1000 individuals, 22- 37 years) and developing populations (~650 individuals, 5-21 years). The approach is innovative, as it proposes to use model-driven, data-driven and hybrid approaches to model SC-FC relationships and that it poses to ex- plore sex effects, heritability, cognitive and developmental implications of SC-FC relationships. The proposed research is significant in that understanding structure-function relationships across typical development will allow quantification of the impact of disease and reveal avenues for novel treatments in various neurological diseases. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the relationship between brain anatomy, physiology, genetics and cognition throughout human development is paramount to understanding of how it can break down in disease. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NICHD's mission in that it seeks to understand human development and optimize abilities for all.",Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling,10189014,RF1MH123232,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sex Differences', 'Ships', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genome-wide', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,RF1,2021,1292521
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10261410,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic platform', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'implementation intervention', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,1484783
"Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram Project Abstract: Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram Although cognitive decline is a “normal” part of aging, some individuals clearly age better than others. However, the concept of differential aging has been minimally studied for the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations signals carry rich information regarding brain health and brain aging. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with fragmented sleep and altered sleep oscillations. Clearance of cerebral beta amyloid through the brain's glymphatic drainage system occurs mainly in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and depends on EEG slow oscillations. Cortical generators of sleep EEG oscillations overlap with regions of cortical thinning and loss of functional connectivity in AD. Disturbances of NREM disrupt memory consolidation. Finally, deficient REM sleep contributes to dementia. These observations suggest that brain health may be measurable from information contained in the sleep EEG. In preliminary work we have developed EEG-brain age – a machine learning model that predicts a patient's age based on patterns of overnight sleeping EEG oscillations. This allows prediction of age with a precision of +/- 7 years. Our preliminary data suggest diabetes and hypertension, chronic HIV infection, an MCI or AD are reflected in the EEG as excessive brain age, and that excessive brain age is independently associated with reduced life expectancy. Our central hypothesis is that sleep physiology data can provide sensitive and specific biomarkers of brain health. This hypothesis is based on our prior work showing that BAI is elevated in several clinical populations. BAI can be accurately calculated using frontal EEG signals, making it suitable for implementation on at-home EEG devices. The rationale for the proposed research is that validating sleep EEG-derived biomarkers as measures of brain health at the level of individual patients would lay the ground for use in clinical trials and patient care. We plan to accomplish the central objective by pursuing two complementary aims. In Aim 1, we will take a hypothesis-driven approach, and test for associations of specific sleep features with specific cognitive deficits and specific structural pathology. In Aim 2, we will take ad data-driven approach, and develop optimized biomarkers of brain health using a novel form of machine learning known as multitask learning, which combine multiple features of sleep – including conventional features, as well as data-driven features directly learned from the data – to predict or “explain” variation in cognitive performance and in structural brain MRI measures that are indicative of brain health or disease. The project will take advantage of a large and diverse set of sleep data (>33,000 patients), as well as thousands of brain MRI and cognitive testing results. At the conclusion of this study, we expect to have a better understanding of the role sleep oscillations play in brain health, and clinically useful brain health biomarkers. These outcomes will aid development of interventions to promote brain health. Project Narrative: Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram RELEVANCE: Loss of brain function including memory and executive function is an inevitable part of aging, yet some individuals' brains age better than others. We recently developed the brain age index – a statistical model that reports the difference between an individual's apparent brain age, based on the pattern of overnight EEG (brain waves), and their chronologic age. This project will use existing data from 4 large cohorts to further develop and validate sleep EEG-based biomarkers of brain health, by characterizing the relationships of brain waves during sleep to cognitive health and to the structural health of the brain.",Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram,10180268,RF1NS120947,"['20 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Archives', 'Arousal', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Claustral structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drainage procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'General Hospitals', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Koreans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Smoker', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'basal forebrain', 'base', 'brain health', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'functional loss', 'glymphatic system', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multi-task learning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'sleep physiology', 'sleep spindle', 'specific biomarkers', 'therapy development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,RF1,2021,2494802
