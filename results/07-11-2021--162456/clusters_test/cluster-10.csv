"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",10090573,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1

"Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types  This proposal outlines the protocols and techniques I will be using to optimize drug discovery of ASCT2, a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics. ASCT2 plays a key role in increasing the glutamine influx for tumor cells to maintain such high metabolic rates required for rapid proliferation. The first structures of ASCT2 were recently determined experimentally, making this a newly viable target for structure-based studies ASCT2 was only recently discovered to play a critical role in cancer cell metabolism and little medicinal chemistry efforts have been focused on ASCT2 antagonist development allowing immense potential for breaking into new compound scaffolds for further testing. Currently, there have not been any ASCT2 drug campaigns that incorporate computational drug discovery methods and this proposal outlines the first studies dedicated to this.  Many institutions and pharmaceutical companies have implemented computational strategies into drug discovery pipelines as a means to produce viable drug candidates in a more cost-efficient and timely manner. Depending on the target of interest, researchers focus more intently on either ligand-based (LB) or structure-based (SB) methods, but rarely are these two methods hybridized in a sophisticated fashion. By utilizing strategies of both LB- and SB- computational drug discovery, I intend to merge the advantages of both methodologies as a means to sample and filter large chemical space more efficiently. Our lab has active development in two computational chemistry software suites: Rosetta primarily focuses on SB methods whereas the Biology and Chemistry Library (BCL) contains advanced cheminformatics toolsets for LB methods. The focus of my project will be to integrate the RosettaDrugDesign code to allow a more extensive, yet efficient sampling of chemical space using ligand-based techniques. We intend to incorporate these more advanced LB techniques available in the BCL, including multi-tasking artificial neural networks for Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationship predictions, to filter compounds during docking simulations within the RosettaDrugDesign. By bringing together the structure prediction abilities of Rosetta and small- molecule tools of BCL, we anticipate exceptional advances in our abilities to efficiently design drugs for ASCT2. Project Narrative The upregulated influx of amino acids is critical to maintain an altered metabolic state for rapidly proliferating cells such as those found in tumors, making transporters such as ASCT2 a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Computational-based drug discovery methods have not been heavily utilized for ASCT2 due to lack of an experimentally determined structure; however with the recently solved structure, these methods are now possible and highly favorable for guiding medicinal chemistry efforts. This proposal outlines the plans for hybridized structure- and ligand-based approaches for computational drug discovery of ASCT2 antagonists and the experimental validation obtained utilizing in silico methods.","Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types",10003012,F31CA243353,"['Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Transporter', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Facility Accesses', 'Formulation', 'Glutamine', 'Homologous Protein', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serine', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computing resources', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'metabolic rate', 'method development', 'multitask', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38247
"CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy Acute intoxication with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides is a significant public health concern and long-term neurological effects are not well understood. A major obstacle to progress towards reproducible, rigorous preclinical research in the long-term effects of OP- induced status epilepticus is that current experimental approaches often require prohibitively time and labor-intensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring and inherently subjective scoring of seizures by human observers (like the widely used Racine scale). While algorithms for automated seizure detection in EEG are improving, the critically important behavioral manifestations of acquired epilepsy and assessment of its cognitive comorbidities remain poorly quantified. Our parent grant focuses on developing an objective, high-throughput technique to characterize epileptic phenotypes using a new method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) and apply it to automated anti-epileptic drugs (AED) screening. The central idea of MoSeq rests on the discovery that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”) that can be detected without observer bias by artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 3D video analysis. In this administrative supplement project, we propose to employ and refine MoSeq to address key challenges in research into the development of new medical countermeasures (MCM) against nerve agents and OP pesticides. This includes testing if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale by determine epilepsy-specific behavioral modules and associated transition probabilities in mice after acute OP exposure. In addition, given that neuroinflammation is likely to play a key role in OP-induced persistent neuronal circuit disturbance, we will test if microglial depletion can rescue the OP-induced chronic changes in behavioral syllables and transition probabilities. Together, the aims in this administrative supplement will both benefit from and contribute to our parent grant’s goal to develop a reliable, sharable tool for the research community to study seizures and cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy. There is an urgent need for medical countermeasures (MCMs) against nerve agents and organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. The project will leverage from our recent technical breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to test if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on preclinical research by enabling objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epileptic phenotypes in experimental animals after acute OP intoxication to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10227611,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabidiol', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intoxication', 'Isoflurophate', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Observer Variation', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'acquired epilepsy', 'automated algorithm', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical research', 'screening', 'tool', 'valproate']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,123798
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,10092124,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,137956
"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,167900
"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health.

"Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast e1k chemical library (1800 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level.

"Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies Chemical warfare and the use of mustard gas on civilian population poses a major risk. Vesicating agents, such as mustard gas, cause severe damage to the corneas that can result in blindness and severe loss of sight. There are currently limited therapeutic options for treatment of damage caused by vesicating agents. To enable the rapid development of much needed medical countermeasures, the proposed work will test the possibility of drug repurposing. Drug repurposing strategies are based on the identification of new uses for existing drugs. Drug repurposing is a demonstrated successful strategy that can lower the cost of drug development and reduce development time. The key challenge in drug repurposing is the need to identify novel drug-disease relationships. To address this challenge we will deploy a set of innovative microscopy approaches that will provide rich data on the subtle aspects of the impact existing drugs have on corneal healing from chemical injury. Specifically, in Aim #1 we will perform a chemical screen of 770 existing drugs using live, organ culture, image-based assay. Mice corneas will be imaged for 48 hours after wound and sophisticated computer vision algorithm will be used to extract data on stem cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and wound closure. In Aim #2 we will construct spatiotemporal cornea-specific cell atlas of migration, proliferation, inflammatory signaling and gene expression response to chemical injury for controls, and drug-treated corneas. The cell atlases will provide a key resource on the process of chemical injury, the mechanism of action of existing therapies, and the mechanism of action of the most promising new drugs identified in Aim #1. Collectively, the results of this work will exploit the possibility of drug repurposing for the treatment of ocular injury caused by vesicants. The resource we will generate, i.e .the information on existing drugs and the detailed cell atlases of the process of healing will build the foundation for the rapid future development of much needed medical countermeasures. Chemical weapons such as mustard gas can cause severe damage to the eye and lead to blindness. Here we will use sophisticated microscopy tools to test how does the eye heal when treating by existing FDA approved drugs and generate an atlas of the cellular response to chemical injury. Our results will support efforts to repurpose existing drugs to provide much needed medical countermeasures to combat chemical warfare.",Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies,10137251,R21EY031283,"['Accidents', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'End Point Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Injuries', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mustard Gas', 'Organ', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Type I Epithelial Receptor Cell', 'Vesicants', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'combat', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'corneal regeneration', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'first responder', 'healing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical countermeasure', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'response', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell proliferation', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment effect', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,218032
"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short- to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one- third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third-order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARS- CoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10195454,R21LM013683,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Judgment', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protective Agents', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Shock', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'cyclooxygenase 1', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'demographics', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'global health emergency', 'high risk', 'human data', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label use', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'preclinical study', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'public health emergency', 'sex']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R21,2021,225171
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations Project Abstract The number of new products such as drugs, cosmetics and food additives introduced into the market is growing and poses a significant challenge for risk prediction. Currently, vertebrate testing is the industry standard for hazard assessment but has limitations including high costs, and the growing public and corporate sentiment against using vertebrates for chemical testing. Importantly, current toxicity assessment does not incorporate genetic diversity leading to failure of drug candidates and unintended risks to human sub-populations. The celebrated invertebrate model C. elegans has the potential to fill this gap since thousands of genetically diverse nematode populations are available. However, the main challenge is that chronic studies of chemicals in the nematode model is still tedious, precluding large-scale toxicity testing in nematode populations. This proposal aims to develop a high-throughput technology for chronic toxicity screening of diverse genetic populations in adult C. elegans. The focus of our Phase I plan is to pursue chronic toxicity studies on select toxins and generate foundational data highlighting the impact of genetic diversity, and subsequently scale the NemaLife technology to enable large-scale genetic diversity screening. AIM 1: To generate chronic dose-response data on toxins affecting diverse C. elegans strains. We will test the effects of five toxins for which we know the variability in human and rodent responses. Animals will be exposed to toxins daily, followed by scoring of survival, reproductive and neuromuscular health. About 1200 whole-life assays will be conducted with data acquired on 500+ animals per assay condition. We will generate data that will define the rank-order of C. elegans toxin response vis-à-vis mammalian systems, optimize phenotyping conditions for large numbers of strains per species, and define the amount of heritable variation in toxin responses. These pilot data will validate the capabilities afforded by our screening platform. AIM 2: To scale the throughput of NemaLife Technology for thousands of chronic toxicity assays. Currently, NemaLife’s technology has a throughput of hundreds of chronic toxicity assays. However, given the large number of toxins and vast library of genetic strains and wild isolates available, there is a significant need to increase the throughput of our technology. Therefore, we will develop the technology infrastructure and workflow to scale the throughput which includes multiplexing our approach, scale-up of chip fabrication and streamlining data analysis. Technology development at the scale of thousands of whole-life toxicity assays in a few weeks with readouts on animal death and neuromuscular impairments will be a major breakthrough in the field opening up new business opportunities in toxicity testing in the drug and consumer industry. Project Narrative Non-parasitic nematodes offer a powerful in vivo model to scale and measure toxin responses in genetically diverse species anchoring a transformative means to bridge current gaps in predictive toxicology with clinically-relevant end points.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940
"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery. While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell- by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research. FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.","Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes",10268102,R42HL158510,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Aging', 'American', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Contract Services', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Industry', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Myopathy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Contracts', 'Risk Assessment', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer survival', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cell injury', 'cellular imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'compound 30', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'heart cell', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lead series', 'male', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'side effect', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R42,2021,299871
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) place significant clinical and economic burden on patients, their care-givers, and healthcare systems.

"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,10085244,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,356625
"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,10063532,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,360227
"New Methods and Tools for Computational Drug Discovery Project Summary  My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability limitations inherent in current approaches.  We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra- ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod- eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc- turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.  We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac- tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi- dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets, such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.  Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA, a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits. These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient. Project Narrative  The research supported by this award will develop new computational methods and tools for drug discovery so that novel therapeutics can be discovered more quickly and with less expense. The de- veloped methods will be evaluated prospectively in drug discovery projects of high relevance to human health. The resources developed will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software.",New Methods and Tools for Computational Drug Discovery,10161412,R35GM140753,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Molecular Target', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'antiangiogenesis therapy', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'lead candidate', 'lead optimization', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'profilin', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R35,2021,367975
"SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human organ systems require temporally and spatially coordinated multicellular actions at a macroscale to actuate, sustain, or terminate dedicated and vital functions. Cells that comprise discrete or distributed physiologic systems that fail to respond to appropriate stimuli with coordination may cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Collective and coordinated physiologic activities typically involve millions to billions of cells that may span large physical distances. Technologies for quantifying the electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling in these multicellular systems are critically important to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop therapeutic approaches. However, no technology currently exists to quantify rapid mechanical cell responses to transmitted distal perturbations for all cells within a collection of cells. This multi- PI proposal (Chiou (contact PI) and Teitell) aims to develop a new platform imaging technology called SPOT (single pixel optical technology) for concurrent and direct measurements of cellular traction forces over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm2 field of view (FOV) with cellular spatial resolution, and a 1,000 frames/sec temporal resolution. SPOT provides a 4-order of magnitude larger FOV than conventional traction force microscopy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are the test bed here because of a high potential for impact in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Western World. We will demonstrate the ability for SPOT to determine quantitative indices of abnormalities for human CM contraction and relaxation in healthy and diseased states. We will establish proof of concept studies in SPOT screens for small molecules that augment or affect CM contraction in desmoplakin deficient states. We will build a platform that integrates SPOT for direct contraction force measurements and Optical Mapping for electrical property measurements for sheets of CMs. This will enable, for the first time, studies of temporal and spatial electromechanical coupling behaviors for sheets of CMs at single cell resolution. We will distinguish different subtypes of CMs, their distributions, their interactions, and their phenotypic responses under external perturbations. And we will apply this platform to investigate the structural and electromechanical coupling properties of hESC-derived CMs by integrating quantitative biomass and stiffness data measured using non-invasive live cell interferometry (LCI). Changes in biomass and cell stiffness are druggable biophysical parameters with correlates to mechanical contraction/relaxation cycles of CMs. In addition to detailed studies of CMs that have the potential to impact the number one killer of US citizens, SPOT applications should have utility and provide new insights in additional settings that require cell or tissue traction-force generation. Such settings could include models in a dish for wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, or models of diseases that affect cell and tissue structural integrity, such as connective tissue disorders Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes. PROJECT NARATIVE Our proposal is exclusively technology development but portends public health relevance because we will invent a way to quantify previously undiscoverable interactions and mechanical responses to external and internal perturbations in interconnected biological systems, as occurs in physiologic and pathologic states. We will develop, test and fine-tune a new technology platform called SPOT (Single Pixel Optical Technology) to extract mechanical responses at cellular resolution in a very wide field, in real-time, concurrently for all cells in a sheet to enable studies and potentially new-age therapeutics that are currently impossible.",SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles,10160919,R01GM127985,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Biomass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibroblasts', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Giant Cells', 'Goals', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Interferometry', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction Force Microscopy', 'Transplantation', 'Ventricular', 'Western World', 'biological systems', 'biophysical properties', 'body system', 'cancer cell', 'design', 'desmoplakin', 'electrical measurement', 'electrical property', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mechanical properties', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'regenerative', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,379224
"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,10164857,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,399965
"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,10166848,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2021,457521
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"Validation of an in vitro model of progressive fibrosis that mimics Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Abstract We have developed a 3D bioengineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived model of IPF that displays progressive fibrosis and closely phenocopies several characteristics associated with IPF. This model is an extension of our 2D model of progressive fibrosis (Vijayaraj et al., Cell Reports – in press). To make our progressive fibrosis model specific to IPF, we have developed it into a model system that utilizes the lung 3D architecture and specific cell types. Our 3D model displays additional features of IPF such as airway epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and replacement of alveolar architecture. Our proposal aims to improve and validate this 3D model such that it will be amenable to a high throughput drug discovery platform in a patient specific manner for precision medicine. Our project aims to use our unique stem/progenitor cell models of IPF to increase our understanding of the disease and for drug discovery. Specific Aim 1. To improve and validate the 3D bioengineered human iPSC derived model of IPF A. To validate the 3D model of IPF by performing extensive characterization of the model compared to human  IPF lung tissue. B. To characterize the heterogeneity of IPF seen across different patients. C. To characterize the 3D IPF model by known genetic risk factors. Specific Aim 2 – To use our 3D bioengineered iPSC-derived model to study cellular plasticity in IPF To profile cellular plasticity of AECs in our 3D model of IPF and compare it to human IPF tissue using single cell RNA sequencing. Specific Aim 3 – To develop and standardize a high throughput drug screening (HTS) platform to identify new anti-fibrotic therapies using the 3D model of IPF A. To develop a HTS using the 3D model of IPF. B. To develop robust, image analysis pipelines that employ a combination of advanced deep learning  techniques and traditional image processing methods to generate quantitative measures of tissue health. C. To develop and run a pilot HTS to identify small molecules that will perform one or more of the following a)  prevent apoptosis of AEC; b) enhance apoptosis of mesenchymal cells; c) decrease expression of -SMA. Our team includes international experts who study lung biology (Gomperts, UCLA), biology of fibrosis (Vijayaraj, UCLA), an IPF clinician and researcher (Belperio, UCLA), lung pathologist (Wallace, USC), iPSC airway epithelial cell differentiation (Spence, Michigan), single cell RNA seq and analysis (Plath, UCLA), and high throughput drug discovery (Damoiseaux, UCLA) with machine learning algorithms for analysis (Shattuck, UCLA). We are a highly collaborative team that is working together using innovative, patient relevant research approaches to tackle the challenges of modeling IPF to identify new therapies. Project Narrative We have developed a 3D bioengineered model of human Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,10101640,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug repurposing', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,531246
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance.

"In silico safety pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY: A major factor plaguing drug development is that there is no drug-screening tool that can distinguish between drugs that will induce cardiac arrhythmias from chemically similar safe drugs. The current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm. An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological system of the heart. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Cardiotoxicity in the form of deadly abnormal rhythms is one of the most common and dangerous risks for drugs in development. There is an urgent need for new approaches to accurately screen and predict the effects of drugs on cardiac rhythms.

"National Drug Early Warning System Coordinating Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our team enthusiastically submits this proposal to be the next NDEWS Coordinating Center (CC) in response to RFA DA-20-016. The CC is spearheaded by the Cottler Lab (Epidemiology), with investigators from University of Florida's Center for Addiction Research & Education (Nixon, Goldberger, Striley), the Palamar Lab at New York University and the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab-Barenholtz) at Florida Atlantic University. Our CC will maintain strong sentinel surveillance efforts while expanding our Early Warning Network sites, adding leading edge indicators that extend beyond lagged city-level data. We will extend the work of NIDA-funded researchers, while harmonizing and analyzing data, with timely and systematic notifications. The new NDEWS CC will work to seamlessly transition on-going efforts, advance methods and approaches, establish and engage a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), and collaborate with all consortium components to accomplish these Specific Aims: 1) Provide an Early Warning Network of 12 NDEWS sites and 6 Community Epidemiology Workgroup sites for ongoing surveillance of urban, rural, and suburban areas; 2) Utilize established and new key community-level indicators for ongoing surveillance to assess trends in availability, use, and consequences of NPS and known substances, standardized across all sites to facilitate cross-site analyses; 3) Incorporate and leverage novel surveillance methods to ensure early detection of signals of NPS and emerging drug trends, including data from DanceSafe “drug checkers,” Rapid Street Reporting (RSR) with hair testing for NPS exposure, the implementation of a virtual HealthStreet substance user network, and development of an innovative machine learning approach to detect emergence of NPS in real-time through drug retailers (including the “darknet”) and social media platforms; 4) Harmonize standardized indicator definitions for all incoming surveillance data with the input of NIDA, the SAG, and Early Warning Network experts; facilitate cross-site comparability of data; manage quality control; organize, coordinate, and summarize data, and provide organizational and logistical support; 5) Disseminate findings quickly via dashboards modeled after Florida Drug-related Outcomes Surveillance and Tracking System (FROST); push notifications for regular updates and alerts; webinars; virtual Our Community Our Health Town Hall meetings; and traditionally through official reports, peer-reviewed publications, media, and annual reporting at CPDD, and elsewhere; 6) Conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of immediate crisis or need; 7) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support to the enterprise and NIDA; and 8) Train the next generation of scientists in NDEWS methodology.  NDEWS has unrealized potential, and with this funding, we will transform the culture so that NDEWS is NIDA's and the field's go-to source for drug trends in the US. It will provide evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies to eventually reduce the harmful effects of substance use around the world.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,10133177,R44TR002527,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'chemical property', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'melting', 'model building', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,749928
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,10059161,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2021,913527
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,10087862,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,1140875
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we have built a unique platform focused on understanding the use of metabolomics in drug discovery. This proposal will apply the discovery engine on several rare genetic diseases with significant unmet needs.",Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery,10143935,R44GM130268,"['Age', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Capital', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug usage', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'MCF7 cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Transcript', 'base', 'chemical genetics', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'drug repurposing', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro Model', 'insulin sensitizing drugs', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'patient advocacy group', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'rare genetic disorder', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2021,1335997
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10229591,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1364066
