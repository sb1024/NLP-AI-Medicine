"Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records Up to 100 million Americans live with ongoing pain, costing $635 billion annually. In the United States, there are more than 200,000 people living with SLE, a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with multi-organ involvement that disproportionately affects females and racial minorities. Living with a chronic disease such as SLE confers multiple challenges. Pain is a frequent self-reported symptom in SLE and is often one of the first symptoms of the disease. Despite treatment advances, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint. The management of pain in SLE has recently become more challenging because of the alarming epidemic of addiction and mortality attributed to opioid misuse. An estimated 31-46% of patients with SLE use prescription opioids. In one study, 70% of individuals using opioids used them for ≥1 year, and 22% were taking ≥2 opioid medications at the same time. Patients with SLE are nearly twice as likely as the general population to have opioid-related overdose hospitalizations. However, efforts to mitigate opioid misuse cannot be achieved without a detailed understanding and sustained investment in clinical research on the underlying mechanisms that produce and maintain chronic pain. Characterizing the burden of chronic pain in SLE is challenging on at least two counts. First, we lack data on the prevalence and burden of chronic pain in SLE, partly due to the absence of reliable approaches to identify patients with clinically significant pain in electronic health records (EHR). Second, there is a critical need to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms and correlates that drive the pain experience in SLE. In this mentored career development award (K01), Dr. Titilola Falasinnu will use computational methods to increase the understanding of the clinical management chronic pain in SLE using EHR. In Aim 1, Dr. Falasinnu will develop a computational chronic pain phenotyping algorithm using diagnostic codes, pain scores, narrative clinic notes and medications extracted from the EHRs of two large healthcare systems (n~2,400). She will then use the algorithm to estimate chronic pain prevalence in a population-based registry (n~76,000). In Aim 2, Dr. Falasinnu will comprehensively phenotype biopsychosocial correlates of chronic pain using an existing registry of ~500 patients with SLE attending a multi-disciplinary pain center. Throughout the award, Dr. Falasinnu will build on her doctoral training as an epidemiologist and biostatistician to develop new skills in biomedical informatics to conduct impactful pain medicine research. These skills will include working with EHR and registry data, machine learning and natural language processing, pain science, grant-writing, and scientific communication. Through coursework, clinical observation in pain medicine clinics, mentorship, and external conferences and workshops, Dr. Falasinnu will gain the skills needed to apply for her first R01 and pursue a career as a tenure-track principal investigator. Despite treatment advances in rheumatology, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition that disproportionately affects women and racial minorities. The proposed research uses electronic health records to characterize chronic pain and its biopsychosocial mechanisms in SLE. The information learned from the study is relevant to public health efforts to understand the burden and natural history of pain; and it is also relevant to NIAM’s mission of improving the understanding of biopsychosocial components of pain in rheumatology.",Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records,10192176,K01AR079039,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Female', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Clinics', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population-Based Registry', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'biomedical informatics', 'biopsychosocial', 'body map', 'career', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain management', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data registry', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain reduction', 'pain score', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'post-doctoral training', 'prescription opioid', 'profiles in patients', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'skills', 'social', 'sociodemographic variables', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track', 'text searching', 'unstructured data']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126252
"Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction, dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics, efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics. However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However, our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white- coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover, aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a “black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1) Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab. Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification. NARRATIVE As the opioid epidemic has made clear, there is significant need to develop new ways to study chronic pain and relief of pain in preclinical models. Development of an accurate and broadly useful machine learning model and web-based platform will make it possible for researchers to objectively quantify and study spontaneous pain in mice, and hence provide a way to more rapidly identify and validate new analgesic drugs.",Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions,10094266,R01NS114259,"['Acetic Acids', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Regions', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Pain', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Laparotomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Reflex action', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'blind', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain relief', 'cloud based', 'convolutional neural network', 'data repository', 'deep neural network', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'inflammatory pain', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'pain relief', 'painful neuropathy', 'persistent symptom', 'pre-clinical', 'recurrent neural network', 'side effect', 'smartphone Application', 'spontaneous pain', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web services']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,362249
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),10086875,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'ischemic injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,369024
"Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement Project Abstract Overview: This project aims to develop a reliable 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI method with novel metal artifact correction techniques to provide early identification of prosthetic complications causing persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Relevance: THA is one of the most rapidly growing procedures to treat the end-stage hip joint pain and dysfunction, and its annual cases are estimated to reach 572,000 by 2030. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients experience PPSP after the procedure, which, without proper treatment, can significantly impair the quality of life. However, the early identification of pain generators for these patients is very difficult because the current diagnostic methods including X-ray, CT, and MRI, have limited sensitivity to pain and suffer from severe artifacts induced by metal in prostheses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a novel diagnostic approach to accurately identify the abnormal inflammatory changes causing persistent pain to guide the appropriate treatment matched to the exact sources of pain. Approach: We propose the use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for early identification of sources of PPSP following THA. Our previous 18F-FDG PET/MRI study of chronic pain syndromes demonstrated promising improvements in detecting sites of painful inflammation. However, the severe metal artifacts near metallic prostheses limit the application of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to THA patients. Therefore, our first aim in this project is the development of metal-aware attenuation correction for PET to enable reliable 18F-FDG PET near the metallic prosthesis. Our second aim is the development of high-resolution hip MRI at 3T with metal artifact correction to improve our ability for identifying structural causes of PPSP symptoms. Our third aim is to validate the improvements by 18F- FDG PET/MRI in detection of the pain generators compared to PET/CT and conventional MRI. This will be accomplished by correlating the pain score measurements with 18F-FDG PET/MRI abnormalities at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following the unilateral THA procedure. Summary: We propose to develop a novel 18F-FDG PET/MRI approach with metal artifact correction methods for early detection of periprosthetic complications causing PPSP following THA. Successful implementation of our method will enable early indication of individualized, effective treatments for THA patients with PPSP. Project Narrative More than a million cases of total joint arthroplasty are performed in the U.S. each year, but 7% to 34% of the patients are estimated to have persistent postsurgical pain after the procedure. Unfortunately, the identification of periprosthetic pain generators using current diagnostic imaging methods is very difficult due to the limited sensitivity and severe artifacts near metallic prostheses. Focusing on total hip arthroplasty cases, we will develop a reliable 18F-FDG PET/MRI method with metal-artifact-correction that allows highly-sensitive metabolic exam and high-resolution morphologic exam for early detection of painful complications following joint arthroplasty.",Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement,10211307,R01AR077706,"['Address', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Arthralgia', 'Awareness', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heating', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Orthopedic Surgery', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Water', 'attenuation', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pain score', 'pain sensitivity', 'pain symptom', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,420193
"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. There is a critical need to understand what factors contribute to pain in these disorders so that effective management and treatment strategies can be designed.

"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.
