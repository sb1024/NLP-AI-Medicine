"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all. This proposal addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. In doing so, we will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.",Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED),10142463,R18HS025359,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R18,2021,378922
"Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse (or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed and evaluate the accuracy of a novel pH MRI technique for identifying stroke patients with salvageable brain regions, as well as patients at increased risk for developing hemorrhage after an acute ischemic stroke. The results would enhance patient selection for treatment, extend the therapeutic time window, and improve the risk-benefit ratio of recanalization therapies.",Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,10102290,R01NS112242,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Acute', 'Alteplase', 'Amides', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Penumbra', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'endovascular thrombectomy', 'human imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'predict clinical outcome', 'radio frequency', 'risk benefit ratio', 'standard care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombolysis', 'time use', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384813
"Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Project Summary: Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common causes of death and permanent disability worldwide, costing the U.S. health system more than $71 billion per year in lost productivity and medical expenses. Existing paradigms for stroke/TBI diagnosis require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to classify ischemic versus hemorrhagic variants prior to intervention, as treatment for these conditions varies widely. Delays in diagnosis and issues related to transport of unstable patients associated with diagnostic imaging increase the likelihood of neurological injury and death. Translational medical devices that accelerate time-to-treatment in the field or hospital setting may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in stroke/TBI patients on a global level. Our team has developed a portable, rapid and noninvasive imaging and detection device based on eddy current damping (ECD) sensors that can detect brain hemorrhages associated with stroke and TBI, and have demonstrated feasibility in a benchtop, human cadaver and clinical patient setting. This device can potentially diagnose and classify hemorrhagic stroke/TBI subtypes with accurate spatial localization in minutes, rather than hours, thereby guiding early responders and medical providers in making time-sensitive medical decisions for clinical intervention, such as administration of tissue plasminogen activator for ischemic stroke. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel stroke detection device in rapidly triaging stroke/TBI patients and achieving a level of diagnostic accuracy capable of guiding clinical intervention. We hypothesize that: 1) Regional conductivity changes in brain tissue can be imaged and detected using the portable ECD sensor; 2) Hemorrhagic stroke and TBI-related hemorrhages will increase regional conductivity, whereas ischemic stroke will decrease dependent brain conductivity in affected ischemic regions; and 3) Portable stroke imaging may reduce time-to-treatment and diagnosis associated with stroke/TBI. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) Perform benchtop laboratory experiments to further elucidate how direction and magnitude of measured conductivity changes can differentiate stroke subtype and location, 2) Use validated human cadaver stroke simulation models to optimize ECD tri-coil array sensor detection of hemorrhage depth, volume, and location, 3) Utilize machine learning algorithms to quickly classify brain lesions with high accuracy, and 4) Implement early clinical stroke/TBI ECD sensor device testing to gauge effectiveness in live human patients, compared to CT/MR imaging. Development of methods for rapid bedside stroke/TBI diagnosis will provide practitioners with knowledge required to rapidly administer life-saving treatments, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this will help to reduce time-to-treatment and guide triage and intervention, which is likely to translate to improved morbidity and mortality associated with these common conditions. Project Narrative Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are leading causes of major disability and death, and delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic standards in stroke and TBI require that patients undergo computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in a hospital setting to differentiate ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes before initiating treatment. Our study proposes to develop a portable, noninvasive stroke/TBI detection and imaging system based on tri-coil eddy current damping technology, thereby rapidly identifying stroke subtypes, accelerating time-to-treatment, and providing early responders with information necessary to more efficiently administer triaged and appropriate intervention in the field or acute care setting.",Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device,10100064,R01NS119596,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomic Models', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cadaver', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coma', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Gelatin', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological emergencies', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute care', 'base', 'brain parenchyma', 'brain tissue', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'cranium', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging detection', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'ischemic lesion', 'laboratory experiment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid technique', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,408993
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment.

"Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals Project Summary/Abstract Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. Endovascular stroke therapy (EST) has revolutionized the management of large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which accounts for a disproportionate amount of disability in stroke. While this therapy has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials, these studies nearly all required screening patients with advanced NeuroImaging such as CT Perfusion (CTP), a modality not available to the majority of community hospitals. As such, there is a pressing need to for a tool able to identify EST candidates leveraging the infrastructure already existing in community hospitals. We envision a software-based service to automate the NeuroImaging evaluation for EST using CT angiography (CTA). We developed and tested a prototype of a novel deep neural network architecture called DeepSymNet. Our preliminary data indicate that uniquely using CTAs we can determine (1) the presence or absence of a large vessel occlusion (2) if the extent of ischemic core and (3) volume of tissue “at risk” (penumbra) is above or below the thresholds used in the clinical trials, when compared to concurrently obtained results using CTP. We will pursue our project goal with three aims: - Aim 1 - Establish one of the largest multi-institution dataset for neuro-imaging research in acute ischemic stroke. We will acquire a multi-center dataset including imaging and clinical data from 15 hospitals across Texas and California, from a range of scanners, imaging acquisition protocols, and hospital types (i.e. large academic and smaller community). - Aim 2 - Develop interpretable deep learning models to determine the eligibility for EST. We will methodically test a set of model architectures, data augmentation strategies, loss functions and pre-processing steps based on DeepSymNet. We will train and test the algorithm against various definitions of infarct core and penumbral volume based on CTP results. This approach will allow for models adaptable to the everchanging definition of EST eligibility.  – Aim 3 - Evaluate the external validity of DeepSymNet-based models on a large multi-center independent dataset. To accomplish this aim, we will deploy our DeepSymNet software on patient imaging and data from multiple hospitals, which were not used in the creation of the software. We will also validate our approach of using CTA alone to determine ischemic core by validating blinded reads of infarct core from CTA source images performed by expert readers against concurrently acquired CTP results. Completion of these aims will have a sustained, transformative impact by supporting the creation and validation of decision support tools readily translatable to the patient bedside in the vast majority of community hospitals across the country. In doing so, we hope to expand the access to high-quality EST screening to thousands of additional AIS patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE With endovascular stroke therapy, we now have the ability to dramatically improve patient outcomes after stroke. To date, however, screening for patients that may benefit from this procedure has been relegated to larger academic centers, as the advanced imaging modalities required for this evaluation are not widely available. The goal of our proposal is to develop and validate machine learning-based software tools to identify patients eligible for endovascular stroke therapy using CT angiography, an imaging modality readily available in the vast majority of community hospitals.",Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals,10184809,R01NS121154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry Standard', 'Infarction', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical referral center', 'brain tissue', 'care delivery', 'community center', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'heterogenous data', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'perfusion imaging', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'screening', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'support tools', 'thrombolysis', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,481432
"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility",10101667,R44HL145826,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteriogram', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stroke', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'base', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebral vein', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NHLBI,"MAGNETIC RESONANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2021,667050
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,10124424,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'detection platform', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,731023
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.
