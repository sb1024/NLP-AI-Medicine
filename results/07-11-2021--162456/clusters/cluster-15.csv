"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,10219195,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent', 'venous thromboembolism']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2020,17002,0.024551896955036033
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,9858108,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,17591,0.02053755108083937
"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,9907467,F30HL151074,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Triage', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'theories', 'time use', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2020,41178,0.020160203527459574
"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients. This project consists of the development of an automated, population-specific sepsis diagnostic tool and an estimate of the health implications of tool implementation.",Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population,10064529,F31HL154509,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'System', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical practice', 'data cleaning', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'random forest', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2020,45082,0.030045286637139828
"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,9992378,F31LM013403,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Ethnography', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Police', 'Policy Maker', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Service provision', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'court', 'deep learning', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health equity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'social', 'social bias', 'social inequality', 'symposium', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,50520,0.014258754668472668
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,0.014067537614438744
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9931317,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2020,81000,-0.04835759653595324
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life.

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9830682,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,100000,-0.007642131977978549
"Conceptualizing Actionability in Clinical Genomic Screening Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on assessing the value of genomic information. To achieve this career goal, the candidate will: 1. Receive training in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare.

"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciﬁc information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112401,0.016970452411472495
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,-0.0048867494481558
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9891936,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2020,130228,0.0001646238330243616
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9949693,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2020,131517,0.007810569160542205
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,9953749,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2020,143822,-0.019799506915734778
"Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention PROJECT ABSTRACT  In the U.S., from 2011 to 2014, 7,208 maternal fatalities, with the trend worsening year-on-year (CDC, 2016). In addition to the 700+ fatalities, at least 50,000 woman experienced life-threatening complications, annually. According to CDC (2019) for every fatality, 70 more women suffer avoidable, traumatic complications as a result of pregnancy.  Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc, propose the evaluation of a cardiac risk assessment tool for pregnant and postpartum women; this tool updates automatically directly from patient medical records; wearable devices; and patient surveys. Success implies disruptive improvement in women's health. Proposed research involves three key elements: technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDOH) using geospatial mapping of patient locations. Technology: Study technology shall be based on the Invaryant Health Platform (IHP), a technology that automatically ingests data, from medical records, wearable devices, and other sources using proprietary AI based interoperability technology called Mesh-Complex Method Exchange (Mesh-CMX). We propose using the IHP in conjunction with novel prototype-level technology, namely Healthy Outcomes for all Pregnancy Experiences-Cardiovascular-risk Assessment Technology (HOPE-CAT) and the Invaryant machine learning technologies to monitor the patient, based on signals, out-of-range “trip-wires”, and trends in the mother's health data that merit medical intervention. By extending the proof of concept into an early commercial version of the software, and integrating it to the IHP which will automatically update changes in the patient's medical record, we will provide an “early warning” system for mothers and their providers. Data: The study will be tested on patients' medical records using the MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 Million unique patients. The tool will subsequently have the potential to be leveraged to over 90 million medical records for the MedStar and Cerner hospital systems, distilled down to meet specific eligibility criteria including, gender, age, race, pregnancy and medical outcomes. A second phase of this project would take the findings from the retrospective study (this grant request) and use the technology within the Medstar hospital system, to validate the efficacy of the findings in a “real-world setting”. Using our proprietary AI technology, we will compare each mother's progress against a cohort of retrospective data to enhance diagnostics and provide real-time feedback to caregivers and patients. Geospatial mapping: Mapping the patient medical record and the health information to their social setting is vital for understanding the underlying social constructs that affect the health of mothers in different regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc. propose the evaluation of a cardiovascular risk assessment tool (HOPE-CAT) for pregnant and postpartum women utilizing technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDoH) with geospatial mapping. HOPE- CAT, in conjunction with Invaryant's health platform and machine learning technologies, will monitor the patient based on signals, out-of-range ""trip-wires"", and trends in health data. HOPE-CAT will be validated on patient medical records using MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 million unique patients.","Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention",10200448,UL1TR001409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eclampsia', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Gender', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Experience', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Population', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'data ingestion', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health data', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'personalized intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'venous thromboembolism', 'wearable device']",NCATS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,UL1,2020,146537,-0.02211930431132805
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9985019,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2020,148539,0.0050576898395419045
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date, EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage, response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research, since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time- specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting scalable cancer research using EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery, but their utility for research and quality improvement has been limited by a dearth of methods for integrating the unstructured data in which most key cancer outcomes are encoded within EHRs. I propose to apply recent innovations in deep learning to integrate structured and unstructured data to create a dynamic pre-trained model of cancer patients' treatment trajectories, and to apply this model to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for clinical trials at times when they are eligible. I will then evaluate the effect of trajectory modeling on clinical trial accrual as I prepare for an independent research career focused on clinical cancer data science.",Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials,9880481,K99CA245899,"['Academia', 'Adult', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer care', 'cancer clinical trial', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multiple data types', 'neoplasm registry', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'unstructured data']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2020,170176,-0.020175739026123147
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9955220,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2020,177510,0.0237657136097079
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,9892671,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,183209,-0.0029412707328302936
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9906933,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,194806,-0.005930383335695282
"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals. The data will support FDA’s commitment to promoting antimicrobial stewardship.",Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices,10166402,U01FD007057,[' '],FDA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,U01,2020,199999,0.02422037118590422
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine.

"Secure Homomorphically Encrypted National Registry of COVID-19 Recovered Plasma Donors PROJECT SUMMARY Treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) was recently approved by the FDA for seriously ill patients of COVID-19. There are many institutions and hospitals that have implemented CP programs, but they all face the challenge of finding sufficient and appropriate donors. The constraints of matching, imbalances in supply and demand, and privacy concerns pose several challenges to engage donors. Considering multiple stakeholders (patients, donors, hospitals), we will develop new algorithms based on multikey homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of patients and donors, with additional functionality to simplify the registration process, and conduct optimization for plasma donation (of patients who recovered from COVID-19). We are dedicated to the public good and will make freely available the code / resources developed within the framework of this project. If we succeed, our project will build a secure national registry for potential plasma donors and may save many lives. Narrative We are proposing a novel platform for convalescent plasma donation with integrated privacy protection and resource optimization. The goal is to remove the barriers and concerns for COVID-19 recovered patients to donate their plasma to save severely ill patients.

"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome.,10013069,R41DA049615,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Temperature', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Engineering', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hydration status', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Property', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sneezing', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Sweating', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'care costs', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microchip', 'monitoring device', 'nanofabrication', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'neuromuscular activity', 'novel', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid withdrawal', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prenatal exposure', 'printed circuit board', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy duration', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,REKOVAR INC.,R41,2020,225000,0.006815620442122499
"SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge that costs the US over $740 billion annually and lacks the current workforce to address it. Our proposed innovation, SUDCare, is a novel and intelligent mobile application that will be designed to address the pressing needs of primary care patients who have inadequate resources and services for SUD screening and follow-up care. The core components of the proposed innovation will consist of a remote screening tool for the assessment of patients’ risk level of SUD and a chatbot to support logistical and routine queries. Our research team will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to create a scalable and sustainable solution to support an evidence-based SUD screening and treatment protocol. SUDCare has the potential to streamline follow-up clinic encounters and minimize the increasing workload burden placed on PCPs while filling a largely unfilled gap in care for hard-to- reach populations not directly served by any SUD therapeutic solutions available today. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to test technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of SUDCare. We will accomplish this goal using a user-centered design framework following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi- structured formative interviews with stakeholders (i.e., primary care providers, nurses, care coordinators, insurers, health IT specialists) and potential target end users (i.e., patients) (Substudy 1, N=20) recruited from our partnering primary care clinic. The data collected from this Substudy will be used to support the SUDCare development and requirements for integration with clinic workflow and systems. In Aim 2, we will build a working prototype of SUDCare. To create the chatbot prototype, we will train an English language model using a rich, existing de-identified dataset of text-message conversations from previous related work. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the acceptability of SUDCare through usability testing conducted with patients at risk of SUD (Substudy 2, N=8). Results from Phase I will inform a potential Phase II project to further develop SUDCare and conduct a larger-scaled pilot study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SUDCare. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing trend in the United States, and primary care providers have limited resources to help patients with prevention and treatment. In this Phase I SBIR, we will employ a user-centered design approach to develop and demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of an innovative mobile- and web- based toolkit, SUDCare, for primary care patients who are at risk for SUD.

"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, and data quality is even more imperative to achieve to reach the potential of this registry. Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,9953684,R21EY031443,"['Academy', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exfoliation Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Iris', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Secondary to', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data submission', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'research study', 'tool', 'treatment comparison']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,231000,0.030205272310720996
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,10015336,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Blood Pressure', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morality', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Rewards', 'Right to Treatments', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'prospective', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,235205,0.016950839796847552
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death.

"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,9956035,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,243000,0.009594184725710997
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults Approximately 3 million young adults aged 18-44 years currently have diabetes in the United States. This number is projected to increase to ~5.8 million by 2060. Differentiating diabetes types is crucial, because the etiology, treatments, and outcomes of diabetes differ substantially by type. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for ~17% and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ~75% of total diabetes in US young adults. This distribution of diabetes types continuously evolves. We do not have a large-scale surveillance system to monitor the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The widespread use and increasing functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems substantially increase the quantity, breadth, and timeliness of data available for surveillance and reduce costs compared with population-based registries and surveys. EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~6 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adults from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US young adults with those in young adults from other countries and regions. This study is innovative, because it will detect a false negative rate as low as 0.2%, leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. This study will advance our understanding of the age, sex, racial/ethnic, and geographic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The obtained surveillance data will inform planning for healthcare needs, prioritize the allocation of healthcare resources, and reduce health disparities via identifying and prioritizing subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities. The burden of diabetes has been increasing considerably in recent decades in US young adults. However, there is no large-scale surveillance system for monitoring the burden of diabetes by type in US young adults. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and temporal trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US young adults according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults,10085448,U18DP006502,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,-0.0019568813199088353
"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Immobilization', 'Implant', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Older Population', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Skin Temperature', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sports Medicine', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Swelling', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'healing', 'high risk', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'physical therapist', 'post-operative rehabilitation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'rotator cuff tear', 'sensor', 'success', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'wireless communication']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,0.008349775980704832
"Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder The current opioid crisis is significantly impacting millions of lives, healthcare, social welfare, and the economy. Patient interactions with the treatment system coupled with results of completed studies create a wealth of data stored in disparate electronic sources. Therapists and health care providers with limited time and resources face challenges to access, integrate and monitor this vast data set for novel opportunities to improve care. Significant advances would include predicting when a patient will relapse out of a program, and also suggesting optimal personalized care strategies to reengage patients before this negative event occurs.  Survive-OUD will solve these challenges by providing a web-based therapist interface integrating survivor model artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Based on multiple input data domains leveraged from existing electronic medical record sources, survivor recurrent neural networks will be trained to recognize when patients are likely to relapse or drop out of an OUD program. Examples of data domains that can be input to the network include patient demographics, medical and prescription data, engagement with therapy paradigms, and compliance with logistical program tasks. Furthermore, once a patient is noted as high risk, a second layer of algorithms will be developed to recommend a specific and personalized care strategy for retention based on existing best practices in the literature and clinical trials. Therefore, the Survive-OUD platform will also integrate with common literature database and clinical trial repositories. Utilizing an existing AI platform for searching, tagging, and extracting data from database sources, the innovative platform will close the loop on actionable results by recommending updated care options based on potential outcomes learned from best practices in existing literature. The AI architecture developed will greatly improve success rates in opioid addition programs and expand high quality healthcare.  While the commercialized Survive-OUD platform will integrate all features above, Phase I will target feasibility of data aggregation and AI algorithms to detect relapse and recommend intervention strategies. The innovative technical challenge in Phase I is to develop and validate targeted AI tools using data already being captured in patient workflow to allow early prediction of patient retention issues. More specifically, a prototype therapist interface and data network infrastructure will be developed to source personalized patient data as well as literature and clinical trial sources. Once the platform architecture has passed verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection study to determine usability and also provide a rich set of de-identified data for algorithm development. Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection of patient dropout/relapse and appropriate treatment recommendation. The objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of Survive-OUD, an artificial intelligence driven platform to integrate complex data sources, predict patient relapse, and recommend intervention strategies for individuals impacted by opioid use disorder. Currently millions of Americans suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) and program relapse rates are extremely high. Therefore, an advanced, bioinformatics platform that accurately predicts when OUD patients will drop out of programs and offers personalized prevention strategies would provide a novel clinical tool to help combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.","Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder",10133357,R43DA052916,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Service delivery model', 'Social Welfare', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Update', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'retention rate', 'socioeconomics', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"INSILICA, LLC",R43,2020,251348,0.027367017775264547
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10056750,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2020,260660,0.01880564954220422
"Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) Most Americans do not have advance directives or appointed surrogates to guide their medical care in the event that they lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Healthcare teams are sometimes able to identify “default” surrogates, i.e., family or friends who can provide information about the patient's values, goals, preferences, and beliefs. However, a growing number of patients become decisionally incapacitated without any advance directives, appointed surrogates, or default surrogates, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving care that is unaligned with these tenets. Currently there is almost no data describing the prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) or how clinical decisions are made for them. The proposed study will address this gap with two specific aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine (1a) what are the prevalence and characteristics of adults who are INEADS or at risk of becoming INEADS, and (1b) how clinical decisions are currently made for patients who are INEADS. For this aim we will retrospectively review electronic health records from an acute care database of ~40,000 hospitalizations and a home healthcare care database of ~89,000 community dwelling patients using a combination of structured data, natural language processing, and content analysis to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of patients who are currently INEADS and at risk of becoming INEADS in acute care and homecare settings; (ii) Who are the hospital and community personnel and policies involved, (iii) How do patient characteristics and diagnoses influence decisions, and (iv) What is the timeline for making decisions and how expeditiously are decisions reached?  In Aim 2 we will qualitatively explore the phenomenon of INEADS from clinical and patient perspectives. For this aim we will conduct: (1) focus groups with hospital- and community-based healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards, and (2) interviews with community-dwelling patients at risk of becoming INEADS. Sample questions to be explored include (i) What are the barriers and facilitators to formalizing and standardizing the clinical decision-making process for INEADS patients, and (ii) What are the barriers and facilitators to completing advance directives and designating surrogate decision makers among patients at risk of becoming INEADS?  The long-term goal of this project is to provide vulnerable INEADS patients with ethical care that is concordant with their goals and preferences. Knowledge gained from this pilot will inform (1) an intervention study to increase advance directive completion and surrogate designation among patients at risk of becoming INEADS, (2) the development, implementation, and evaluation of formalized decision-making processes for INEADS patients, and (3) the design, delivery, and testing of clinician education on best practices for caring for INEADS patients and patients at risk of becoming INEADS. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The majority of Americans do not have advance directives or healthcare proxies, and more adults are living independently without the support of family or friends. As a result, patients who lose the ability to make healthcare decisions for themselves may not have any voice in deciding what types of treatments they will receive. This study will investigate (1) how many patients in the hospital and community have no advance directives, surrogate decision makers, or ability to make decisions for themselves, and (2) how clinical teams make decisions for these patients.",Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS),10038963,R21NR019319,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'care preference', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'court', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'family support', 'high risk', 'improved', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social', 'structured data', 'surrogate decision maker']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,284481,0.03047726501224403
"Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction Project Summary:  We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a mobile health software system for clinicians to conveniently and/or remotely manage and quantitatively document the healing process of chronic ulcers such as diabetic foot ulcers. Timely, frequent, and accurate documentation on wound appearance and dimension is vital for the growth assessment and tracking of treatment effectiveness. However, current practice is subjective, inconsistent, and even invasive. The absence of easily accessible, repeatable, and quantitative data affects care coordination among the medical staffs and handicaps the best treatment planning for individual patients. For chronic wound sufferers, countless routine visits and the ever increasing high treatment costs also hinders their chance of timely treatment and urgently calls for a convenient alternative.  Built on a seamlessly integrated client-server framework, the proposed management software allows clinicians to easily exchange wound data with the cloud server, analyze the wound healing information, and manage patient's treatment. Together with potentially other wound sensor data, our software system offers objective and quantitative assessment on wound tissue healing status, avoiding misinterpretation or inconsistent grading among medical staffers. With large patient data to be collected, the proposed software is perceived to assist clinicians with evidence based healing prediction and more effective personalized treatment planning.  Every year, approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. The number is projected to grow rapidly due to the aging baby boomer population and a sharp rise in diabetes and obesity. Chronic wound healing is a lengthy process with months or even years of treatment time. Absence of personalized attention could easily cause infections and complications, leading to loss of limb. Evidence suggests that 80% of amputations are actually preventable through access of good quality and routine care. With the ever increasing high healthcare costs and the likelihood of early discharge to home care, patients are highly vulnerable to complications due to the lack of routine checkup or personalized care. All of these validates the urgent need of an alternative, convenient, and low cost clinical practice as what our mobile health app is able to provide. Project Narrative  The proposed mobile health software system to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians a convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and treatment tool, empowering them to provide personalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers. With its unique client-server framework and many advantages over existing standard of care, the proposed management system will have a reasonably large market share in this rapidly growing multi-billion dollar industry. Lastly, the proprietary mobile health technology can be used for the treatment of other type of wounds and diseases such as burns, acute wounds, battle wounds, and endoscopic diseases.",Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction,10081799,R44AG067799,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Burn injury', 'Chronic Care', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Information Management', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stasis Ulcer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Visit', 'Visual Perception', 'Wound models', 'acute wound', 'augmented intelligence', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'care coordination', 'checkup examination', 'chronic ulcer', 'chronic wound', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data management', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'dimensional analysis', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'healing', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 designs', 'programs', 'routine care', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIA,"XYKEN, LLC",R44,2020,298277,0.013103408620060052
"Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects adults of all ages yet can present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from chest pain to shortness of breath, syncope, or seizure. Currently, physicians can assess for this condition with a blood test (D-dimer) which has high sensitivity but very poor specificity, thus resulting in a larger number of false positives. Alternatively, or in the case of a positive D-dimer, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan can be used, both of which are expensive and expose the patient to a significant amount of ionizing radiation. To develop a more specific blood test for PE, Biocogniv will apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to aggregate analysis of existing blood biomarkers measured on two commercially available multiplex immunoassay platforms, one of which is currently used in hospital labs. A sufficiently accurate, rapid and cost-effective test could be broadly applied (i.e., like troponin-I for myocardial infarction) to reduce overuse of CT, simplify ED decision making, and reduce the number of deaths from unrecognized PE. In this proposed Phase I single center study, Biocogniv will collaborate with the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) to demonstrate proof-of-concept for diagnosing PE in emergency department (ED) patients for whom there is sufficient concern for PE to warrant a D-dimer test as part of routine clinical care. Specific Aim I is to collect blood from 225 emergency department (ED) patients at UVMMC who were suspected of having PE (including 75 patients that are confirmed to have PE by CTPA), and analyze the blood plasma with quantitative immunoassays to create training and validation datasets for AI analysis. Immunoassays will be comprised of a set of 6 rapid FDA-cleared chemiluminescent immunoassays performed in parallel, and a 20-plex bead-based immunoassay panel targeting known cardiovascular and inflammatory markers associated with acute PE. Specific Aim II is to develop AI data models for two pretest populations—all D-dimer tested patients and just D-dimer positive patients—for bead-based and point-of-care immunoassay datasets (analyzed separately), then evaluate the performance of each data model on a subset of blood plasma data withheld for validation. As part of the evaluation of AI data model performance, the potential impact of study size on data model accuracy will be simulated by plotting specificity as a function of training sample number to show that adding more samples can improve test results. The performance of each approach (i.e., AI methodology applied to a given immunoassay panel for a given pretest population) will be compared and used to plan a Phase II multi-center study and to identify and attract a suitable instrumentation partner. Biocogniv’s end goal is to develop a rapid, highly specific and sensitive FDA cleared test for PE that will become the standard of care for initial diagnosis and triage of patients with potential pulmonary embolism, disrupting the $2B/year D-Dimer market and improving ED patient care. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition that presents with non-specific symptoms (including chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting) and is notoriously difficult to diagnose: as many as 1 in 3 Emergency Department (ED) patients ultimately diagnosed with PE are initially mis-diagnosed, and up to 1 in 3 PE deaths are only discovered upon autopsy. Biocogniv seeks to develop a new blood test for PE that is just as sensitive as the existing D-Dimer test, but that also has the higher specificity needed to screen and stratify all emergency department patients with PE-like symptoms. The expected impact of such a test would be to increase patient safety by reducing the overuse of radiative imaging, standardize clinical care processes, reduce costs and save lives.",Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood,10081921,R43HL154941,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Creatine Kinase MB Isoenzyme', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dyspnea', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunoassay', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myoglobin', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Troponin I', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Venous system', 'Vermont', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'instrumentation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient safety', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,BIOCOGNIV INC.,R43,2020,299749,-0.02584961510799571
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9935103,R01HD092239,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'acute care', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,302394,0.012251962536543428
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes. Proper patient self-management is perhaps the most critical and under-exercised element for patients to achieve appropriate glycemic control and thus mitigate complications and comorbid conditions, and implement appropriate preventive strategies (e.g., vaccines, exercise, healthy diet). In previous work we have shown that educating patients by using content in their medical records improved diabetes outcomes and that NoteAid, a multi- module natural language processing system that links medical jargon in electronic health records to definitions, has improved self-reported comprehension.

"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data dissemination', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient health information', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2020,340000,0.001735398588036766
"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,0.021083769602032006
"Assisted living communities- transforming predictive data into proactive care for COVID-19 ABSTRACT Recent data suggests that that older Americans who contact COVID-19 are at greatest risk for hospitalization and poor outcomes. Additionally, due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for developing COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Since the identification of first US case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, several outbreaks have been identified in long-term care and assisted living facilities with evidence of rapid spread. Older residents and the staff of long-term care assisted living facilities as well as public health officials are facing a multitude of challenges which render early detection of COVID-19 infections difficult in these facilities and which have posed a major barrier to the efforts to control the spread of infection. Adding to these challenges, more than half of residents with positive COVID-19 test results are asymptomatic at the time of testing, further contributing to transmission. There is an urgent unmet need for strategies for monitoring of residents in long-term care and assisted living facilities to facilitate early detection of the infection using means that require minimal person-to-person contact. While the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread is being addressed by several contact tracing apps, assessing the risk for development of severe symptoms and hospitalization in these community residents requires active physiological monitoring and ecological momentary assessment in the context of preexisting clinical conditions and presents an immediate unmet need. With this project, we propose to deliver a user- friendly COVID-19 early detection alert platform (COVID-Alert) that integrates: 1) biosensor ensemble that noninvasively and continuously monitor and record critical vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and activity level); 2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using the 5-question set released by CDC and adopted across US by healthcare providers and health insurance industry; 3) artificial intelligence framework that triggers an alert based on synthesis of real-time physiological biosensing data feed, EMA monitoring of symptoms, with personalized risk profiles of preexisting conditions derived from electronic health record maintained by the facility. COVID-19 clinical decision support integrated into the workflow of long-term care facilities will ensure that residents receive appropriate and timely care (resident level) and ongoing surveillance to prevent an outbreak (facility level) while avoiding unnecessary staff exposure. This study brings together a strong interdisciplinary team of experts in engineering, informatics, data science, machine learning, and CDS. The advanced data-driven predictive model will be trained and validated using both high-dimensional EHR data and clinician feedback. The process of the algorithm development and clinical implementation will be closely monitored and evaluated through formative and summative evaluation. NARRATIVE Due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for hospitalization from COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying.

"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles.

However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing.

"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9873880,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,376860,0.01669843064519392
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19. Finally, we will develop user-friendly interfaces for our models to support research and public health decision making for COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",10150283,R01AI151176,"['Age', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Social Distance', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multi-component intervention', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic preparedness', 'parent grant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy', 'ventilation', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387199,0.0010067771505562892
"Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care Summary: Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care  A future vision of clinical decision support must transcend constraints in scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The shortage of 100,000 physicians by 2030 reflects unmet (and unlimited) demand for the scarcest healthcare resource, clinical expertise. Over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to medical specialty care, with delays contributing to 20% higher mortality. There is no quality without access.  Our goal is to develop a radically different paradigm for outpatient specialty consultations by inductively learning clinical workups embedded in clinical data. We focus on predicting the concrete clinical orders for medications and diagnostic tests that result from specialty consultations. This can power a tier of fully automated guides that will enable clinicians to initiate care that would otherwise await in-person specialty visits, opening access for more patients.  The major scientific barriers are advances in data science and decision support methods for collating clinical knowledge, with continuous improvement through clinical experience, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Our innovative approach is inspired by collaborative filtering algorithms that power “Customers like you also bought this...” recommender systems with the scalability to answer unlimited queries, maintainability through statistical learning, and adaptability to respond to evolving clinical practices.  Our team uniquely combines expertise in clinical medicine, electronic medical records, clinical decision support, statistics and machine learning to enhance medical specialty consultations through aims that seek to: (1) Develop methods to generate clinical decision support by predicting the clinical orders that will result from Endocrinology and Hematology specialty consultations; (2) Evaluate and iteratively design clinical collaborative filtering prototypes based on clinical user input on usability and acceptability; and (3) Determine which consult clinical order patterns are associated with better results through reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks. Completion of these aims will yield a sustained, powerful impact on clinical information retrieval and knowledge discovery for synthesizing clinical practices from real-world data. By addressing grand challenges in clinical decision support, adoption of these methods will fulfill a vision that empowers clinicians to practice to the top of their license, making healthcare more scalable in reach, responsiveness, and reproducibility Project Narrative There can be no quality without access, and over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to the scarcest healthcare resource: Human medical expertise. Building on methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed research will automatically learn practice patterns from electronic medical records.

"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9965911,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,399950,0.006734383586515753
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,9954467,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2020,402913,-0.03012575527364747
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,9947226,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,409049,-0.01802582262298079
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9870948,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,420434,0.027821408641327844
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10099785,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disclosure', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'court', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,429327,0.0128559478846632
"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,9946956,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,439224,0.03278244546401112
"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",9932165,R18HS026886,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2020,443454,0.04845915141058773
"Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients 37,000 patients a year receive an external ventricular drain (EVD) in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US, generating in-hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is great motivation in the neurointensive care unit for the optimization of EVD management to reduce infection rates, accurately determine need for permanent shunting, and to do so efficiently in order to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay (LOS). Risk factors for ventriculitis include EVD duration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling frequency, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and insertion technique. Severe CSF disturbances in patients with IVH and EVDs limit the value of routine CSF analysis for ventriculitis prediction. And ventriculitis diagnosis is imprecise, with only a minority declaring culture positivity while all still demanding antibiotic treatment and delay of permanent shunt. This leads to unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment and increased LOS (30.8 vs 22.6 days), with the associated cost ($30,335 more) and morbidity (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, emergence of drug-resistant pathology). The process of determining permanent shunt dependence is variable between institutions, particularly around the decision of when to begin weaning the EVD or predicting delayed resolution. These decisions in the subacute period determine LOS and associated adverse events, exposure to radiography, and commitment to potentially unnecessary permanent foreign materials in the CNS, which then carry lifelong risks for infection and blockage. There is no accurate noninvasive test (that does not further introduce infection) to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. In previous work, we were able to predict with good accuracy who would need permanent shunt placement using ICP waveform analysis collected during a 24 hour clamp trial. However, a complex model can only be justified if it achieves a diagnosis earlier or more accurately than traditional clinical methods. In preliminary work, we clustered raw ICP waveforms and found a pattern of waveforms specific for ventriculitis that appears 1 day before diagnostic cultures are sent. Our central hypothesis is that there is a temporal quantitative signal in ICP waveform reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to optimize acute hydrocephalus management. Impact and Significance: Noninvasive quantitative models based on ICP waveform analysis that diagnose ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt would decrease the duration of EVD and the frequency of CSF sampling, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing LOS, associated adverse events of ICU stay, and empiric antibiotics. There is no accurate noninvasive test to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. Accurate noninvasive sequential machine learning models could decrease external ventricular drain duration and cerebrospinal fluid sampling frequency, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing length of stay and empiric systemic antibiotics.",Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients,10057040,R21NS113055,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drainage procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Harvest', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Charges', 'Hour', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'intraventricular hemorrhage', 'long short term memory', 'recurrent neural network', 'vector']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,445500,-0.0003479899576168418
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,0.03269116104493182
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,0.013051188052543551
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,0.026544926023105223
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10003227,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,506170,0.005723273126803466
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,-0.009048272368532907
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health. The tools proposed in this research may provide a low-cost, scalable method to improve detection of cognitive decline.",A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings,10091002,R61AG069729,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Appointment', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Excision', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Health system', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'care providers', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'patient health information', 'patient screening', 'population health', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'uptake']",NIA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R61,2020,564218,-0.01732336024293721
"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10033908,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,565519,0.008272100852289094
"An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support ABSTRACT Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes, clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources. We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in 44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006- 2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR- SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis, informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2). We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR- based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support- cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities. NARRATIVE Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes and is critical to racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes.

"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10092423,R61AG069770,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Expenditures', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Printing', 'Private Sector', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care systems', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'personalized care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2020,592048,0.013102117739680752
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly.

"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9941090,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,605875,0.006335928687678631
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9994228,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2020,618291,-0.003557510510786265
"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,-0.0020997426174771583
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients. The proposed work will have a significant impact on clinical management of FH patients.",EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia,9938607,R01HL135879,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Awareness', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoprotein (a)', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Xanthomas', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care providers', 'case-based', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'epidemiology study', 'evaluation/testing', 'family burden', 'genetic testing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'point of care', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,638566,0.032366235654480935
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9930157,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,644350,0.028034810219383834
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,9886227,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9846016,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation environment', 'stressor', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,648089,0.035112626820856044
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10091300,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,650000,0.019325119185485812
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,10001603,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,654816,-0.041532660626085696
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,10187768,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,656378,0.014529770028186976
"Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy Project Summary/Abstract Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs). Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy. For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.  Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.  The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making. Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.  We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.  The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research, biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care. Narrative Two out of three people treated with select types of chemotherapy experience a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that causes pain, discomfort and numbness in the extremities and contributes to poor quality of life. We do not know who is at greatest risk for this side effect or how patients and providers weigh the risks of neuropathy against the potentially life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. The proposed study will help identify patients at high risk for chemotherapy induced neuropathy and assess how patients and clinicians might use information about neuropathy risk to make better informed decisions about cancer care.",Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy,9955985,R01CA249127,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Breast', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neuropathy', 'Numbness', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Platinum', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Vinca Alkaloids', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care systems', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy induced neuropathy', 'clinical decision-making', 'community based practice', 'comorbidity', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fall risk', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical ability', 'medication safety', 'neurotoxicity', 'older patient', 'predictive modeling', 'side effect', 'survivorship', 'taxane', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,663447,-0.010025547718088359
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes.

"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,9901106,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,750249,-0.05261609116661001
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9912846,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,761406,0.026071487611334335
"Clinical and Translational Science Award PROJECT SUMMARY: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. COVID-19 cases in the New York City tri-state area have reached an extraordinarily high number and have quickly become the epicenter region of the crisis in the United States. In New York State alone, there are over 372,000 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2020. NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has been particularly hard hit, with more than 8,100 COVID-19 hospitalizations to date. In response, the entire clinical research community is marshalling resources in an attempt to improve our understanding of how the virus spreads, how it infects various tissues in the body, which patients are more susceptible to infection and fatal outcomes, which therapeutics improve symptoms and survival, whether the immune response confers long-lasting protection against reinfection, and many other crucially important questions. The complexity of the development of this disease and unpredictability of progression into severity, as well as the variety of phenotypic outcomes observed during and post COVID-19, pose major challenges in understanding, predicting, preventing, managing and treating this disease and its sequelae. Answers to these challenges can only be achieved through the comprehensive analysis of a significantly high number of COVID cases. Given how recent and unknown this disease is, and its inherent epidemic nature, there is a limited number of cases at individual medical institutions. The limitation of number of cases per institution becomes even more relevant when isolating subpopulations with specific health conditions and across the lifespan. This proposed study will aim to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by supporting the formation of a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S.: COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19). COMBATCOVID will bring together electronic health records (EHR) data from multiple participating institutions into a shared centralized database. As part of the COMBATCOVID effort, biorepository data of COVID-19 patients collected by some of the participating institutions will also be shared and linked to the respective EHR data. The COMBATCOVID consortium will be responsible for transferring EHR data pertaining to participating institutions interested in contributing EHR data to the N3C database. PROJECT NARRATIVE: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. To adequately understand the virus much more data is needed, necessitating sharing of data across multiple institutions.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10133378,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,772462,0.02053755108083937
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,9946462,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,784220,-0.005787592747137932
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9873997,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,791339,-0.02226043871055007
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9838270,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,794994,0.003082008293021849
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,0.008487153817304288
"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9864102,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,847935,0.010507552725368238
"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,9998610,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,855710,-0.024558426833715702
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,0.020158651795545966
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10092237,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1094329,-0.004027343582838674
"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE IV grant will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the clinical impact of PRS derived from diverse populations and the clinical impact of returning these results along with family history and clinical risk information to participants and their healthcare providers.",eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare,9988785,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Family', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Risk stratification', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'data resource', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'screening', 'support tools', 'trait']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,1216161,-0.006416152591243223
"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return. Project Narrative As part of the eMERGE IV (E4) Network clinical trial, we propose to develop 5, and investigate the implementation of 15, “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a large set of diverse participants.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9990638,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'randomized controlled design', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2020,1744950,0.02059031214091706
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9914111,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,7231781,-0.02983318018130756
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9794015,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2019,45016,0.024551896955036033
"Medication plan concordance between patients and providers in COPD patients Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is projected to cost $50 billion in 2020 and is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US. Despite the association of poor adherence with higher mortality in COPD, there is poor adherence among COPD patients. COPD patients have 4 times the prevalence of mild to moderate cognitive impairment (MMCI) than non-COPD patients. Adherence is a vulnerable process and the presence of MMCI is associated with worse adherence. Additionally, 40% of patients with MMCI go unrecognized by providers. Adherence relies on effective patient-provider communication on the medication plan (medication, dose, frequency, and route) and patient understanding of the prescribed plan. The high prevalence of MMCI in COPD patients likely contributes to poor patient-provider communication, subsequent concordance, and ultimately poor adherence. Patient-provider communication as measured by concordance has yet to be studied or targeted for intervention. This study will leverage the ongoing observational Medication Adherence Research in COPD patients study (MARC Study R01- HL128620 PI Eakin) which is looking at the impact of adherence on health outcomes in COPD. Participants are over 40, carry a diagnosis of COPD with consistent spirometry (FEV1/FVC <70% and FEV1<80% predicted), and are on maintenance therapy for COPD. This proposal will capitalize on the MARC population by adding a sub-study of patient-provider concordance on medication plans and the influence of MMCI on such concordance. Concordance analysis will be conducted on pairs of patient and provider reported medication plans. MMCI will be measured by validated assessments including Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Weschler Memory Scale. Using logistic regression we will examine the impact of MMCI on concordance. A qualitative sub-study evaluating the impact of MMCI on patient-provider communication and concordance on medication plans will be conducted with the addition of semi-structured phone interviews with both patients and providers. Participants with and without MMCI and those concordant and discordant as well as their providers will complete semi structured interviews on the facilitators and barriers to patient-provider concordance and the impact of MMIC on communication and concordance. We expect to find that concordance among patients and providers is poor and the presence of MMCI is a barrier to concordance. The insight into patient and provider perceptions of adherence and communication will uniquely poise this study to inform the development of interventions aimed to improve patient-provider communication and subsequent adherence to medications. Project Narrative COPD has high cost and high morbidity and mortality, yet despite having interventions available to reduce morbidity and mortality adherence is poor. COPD patients have a higher than average presence of cognitive impairment, which has been shown to be associated with poor adherence. Communication between COPD patients and providers as measured by patient-provider concordance on medication plans has not previously been investigated and may provide insight into intervention development to improve communication and ultimately adherence.",Medication plan concordance between patients and providers in COPD patients,9820196,F32HL143864,"['Adherence', 'Behavior', 'CCL7 gene', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'patient-clinician communication', 'patient-level barriers', 'provider-level barriers', 'therapy development', 'treatment planning']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,60100,-0.0015078030188183423
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9616227,R36AG057949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Physical environment', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'burden of illness', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'segregation', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomic disadvantage']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2019,73946,0.001286526550100219
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,0.014067537614438744
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9808271,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'injured', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2019,81000,-0.04835759653595324
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life. The proposed research provides important methodological advances for extracting these insights from widely available patient health records.",Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records,9744166,K99LM012926,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cluster computing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'health record', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,89260,0.022897862857402165
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,0.03623924018746974
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9623369,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,100000,-0.007642131977978549
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9646811,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2019,130618,0.0001646238330243616
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9724447,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2019,130717,0.007810569160542205
"Characterizing Prehospital Delay and Outcomes in Patients Treated for Potential Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department Delayed treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be a matter of life or death. Each 30-minute increase in treatment delay raises the one-year mortality rate by 7.5%. The median patient prehospital delay time in presentation to the emergency department (ED) is more than two hours and has ranged from 1-24 hours, raising the risk of one year mortality up to an astounding 360% across studies. Emergent reperfusion targets (<90 minutes) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been largely met with no resultant decrease in mortality suggesting that prehospital, rather than in-hospital delay, is contributing to poorer patient outcomes. In addition, ACS is associated with multiple debilitating symptoms, impaired functional status, repeat visits to the ED, and frequent healthcare utilization but inadequate attention has been paid to the relationship between prehospital delay (defined as time of symptom onset to arrival in the ED) and these patient outcomes. The objective of this secondary data analysis is to identify multiple, theory-based factors associated with prehospital delay and examine the association of prehospital delay with the outcomes of healthcare utilization and persistent symptoms. The sample includes patients presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered an evaluation for possible ACS. Data from the prospective Think Symptoms study, whose main aim was to characterize the influence of gender on symptoms during ACS, will be used for analyses. The dataset includes a multiethnic sample of 1064 patients (400 women and 664 men) presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered a cardiac evaluation. Data were collected in four academic and one non- academic medical center in four regions of the US. The dataset is unique in that it includes patients ruled-in for ACS and ruled-out for ACS as well as symptom data collected at presentation to triage, in the ED examination room, and one and six months following discharge. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) Identify predictors of prehospital delay for potential ACS by final diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS) including patient factors, event factors, and transportation factors; 2) Determine the association between prehospital delay and one and six-month health care utilization and symptom outcomes by diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS); and 3) Determine the relative contribution of patient, event, and transportation factors on patient outcomes attributable to prehospital delay. Multilinear and logistic regression modeling adjusting for relevant covariates will be used to address aims 1 and 2. Path analyses, a form of statistical equation modeling will be used to address aim 3. This novel work will provide models of patient factors influencing delay that will fill knowledge gaps and aid in the design of patient-centered interventions to reduce prehospital delay for ACS and improve patient outcomes. The outcome of this novel secondary analyses of data from the Think Symptoms study will be to advance science by providing data on the relationships between factors influencing prehospital delay and the potential impact on post-discharge patient outcomes. This analysis also has the potential to improve patient care since we will use our findings to develop new sex and age appropriate clinical interventions to improve outcomes by reducing treatment-seeking delay and improving symptom management for individuals at risk for, or previously diagnosed with, ACS.",Characterizing Prehospital Delay and Outcomes in Patients Treated for Potential Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department,9953775,R21HL140277,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency medical service', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Management', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Triage', 'Undifferentiated', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'acute symptom', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care seeking', 'critical care nursing', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'impaired functional status', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'persistent symptom', 'prospective', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'success', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'theories']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,137413,0.0044634623626169335
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial.

"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work and improve the capacity of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care patterns across hospitals using electronic health record data, and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better sepsis prevention and treatment strategies.  ","Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care",9742497,K08HS025008,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2019,149472,0.025095575310128303
"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class 2 medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions.

"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays.

"Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient Insight is working to drive more informed medical decisions by designing a real-time interface that dynamically captures and presents prior history for complex patients in less time and with more completeness than using their electronic health record (EHR) system. The company is developing proprietary data mining and natural language processing algorithms that show promise for identifying, aggregating, and displaying the most essential EHR data for patients with complex conditions while at the same time working with clinicians to design the visual interface to reduce the cognitive burden and support diagnosis and treatment decisions. The specific goals of this phase I project are to test the feasibility of developing Patient Insight’s core solution to (1) use advanced analytics and natural language processing to mine and prioritize the most relevant information for use by (ED) physicians and (2) develop an clinician-informed, visual display of that essential information to timely support clinical decision-making sufficient to reduce medical errors, improve health, and control costs. In phase I, Patient Insight will work with Universal Health Systems, the parent company of George Washington University Hospital, to co-develop and test the platform for efficacy in the ED as a precursor to continued development of this core solution/product. This will involve using EHR data to assess comprehensiveness to reconstruct history for five groups of chronically ill patients (e.g., advanced cancer, coronary heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pain, and schizophrenia) who are admitted with high-frequency chief complaints of abdominal pain, chest pain, and fever. This will include mining, prioritizing, and presenting information to clinicians using a total of 30 dimensions of data regarding patient’s prior ED and hospital visits including both structured (e.g., diagnosis, medications, labs, imaging test types, EKG date/time) and unstructured data (e.g., images, physician notes, consult notes) to establish physician consensus on the data most valuable to medical decision-making and co-design data visualization tools to render a clear patient history. Our aims include: (Aim 1) Establishing the feasibility of leveraging provider-as-user-centered design to guide development of a data visualization platform that enables providers to readily “see” the most complete patient record for the five groups of complex patients, and (Aim 2) Conducting usability testing and compare the completeness and efficiency of using the enhanced platform on the five patient categories with usual care. Success in phase I will enable the company to validate a ‘proof of concept’ for developing its clinician-as-user-centered design process to inform a phase II research and development effort to design a commercially viable clinical decision support tool for hospitals and health systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient Insight seeks to determine the feasibility of its proposed platform to aggregate and present the clearest picture possible of a patient’s history for time-constrained emergency department (ED) providers sufficient to drive improved medical decision-making, safety, and improved health outcomes for complex patients at the point-of-care and across disparate EHR systems. The strategy is to leverage our capability to extract discreet and unstructured data from select EHR systems and engage providers in the design of key elements of information display to reduce duplicate testing, lower medical errors related to misinformed treatment choices, and reduce unnecessary treatment and costs. Proving feasibility will enable Patient Insight to structure a partnership with Universal Health Services and inform further development and testing of its core solution across multiple ED facilities.",Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care.,9778547,R43LM013130,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Control', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intuition', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical History', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chronic pain', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive load', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'point of care', 'research and development', 'stem', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice', 'unnecessary treatment', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2019,155520,-0.00227260978077308
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9784789,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2019,159914,0.006583573031764722
"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine – the integration of “big data” using data science in order to achieve “precision health” – what could be summed up as “data science of the future”. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of “precision medicine” as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. “Big Data” using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning). Precision Health uses a “big data” approach to focus on disease prevention and detection throughout one’s lifetime.","Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population.",9929780,U01HG009599,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biosensor', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Sum', 'Work', 'data integration', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'formal learning', 'genetic information', 'informal learning', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,166973,-0.00038919136848685517
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9739347,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2019,168188,0.01040411044057954
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,0.02363594488879937
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9983413,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,190216,0.04539784571824888
"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9827744,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2019,192385,0.0237657136097079
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9681485,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,195076,-0.005930383335695282
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common radiation-related toxicity that has been recognized for over a century but often ignored as clinically inconsequential. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated strong association of high grade RIL (seen in 30-50% of patients) with poor prognosis. The pervasive role of radiotherapy in the curative management of solid tumors supports the need to develop mitigating strategies, particularly for patients with a high risk of developing grade 4 (G4) RIL. We have compelling evidence from both clinical and preclinical work that severe RIL impacts cancer control and therapy effectiveness, and methods to reduce RIL may improve treatment outcomes. To further develop these approaches for clinical translation, we have proposed 2 specific aims. In aim 1, we will build on our initial prediction model for G4 RIL and leverage our large database of esophageal cancer patients who have completed chemoradiation (CRT) to develop a better predictive model for G4 RIL so that we can rapidly and efficiently identify the highest risk patients for mitigating strategies. In aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and safety of raising the baseline lymphocyte levels by autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) prior to initiating CRT. Fundamentally, this research will allow us to develop the necessary computational tool capable of properly identifying patients at risk for developing severe RIL, and complete a small feasibility and safety study of using ALI as a way to raise the baseline pre-treatment lymphocyte levels so that the probability of developing G4 RIL could be possibly curtailed. By targeting the at-risk patients to receive RIL mitigating strategies, we will hopefully be able to improve the cancer outcomes of standard cancer therapies, and build on current innovative strategies of immunotherapy and radiation combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Radiation therapy, a key pillar in the management of cancers, causes a common yet ignored side effect of radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL). Severe RIL has been linked to poor outcomes of patients, presumably due to reduced immune surveillance thereby increasing disease recurrence after radiation therapy. We propose developing a prediction model to help identify who are most at risk for developing severe RIL, and conduct a pilot study to help reduce the impact of RIL so that clinical outcomes for these at-risk patients will improve in the future.",Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion,9807793,R21CA240881,"['Applications Grants', 'Bayesian Prediction', 'Blood Component Removal', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Inferior', 'Infusion procedures', 'Link', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nomograms', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'autologous lymphocytes', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'fundamental research', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'radiation effect', 'response', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety study', 'side effect', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2019,211410,-0.02032809973209412
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management ABSTRACT Despite the over 90% efficacy of diabetic retinopathy (DR) treatment, it continues to be the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans. Over 30 million adults in the US have diabetes. Of these, 28% will develop DR and 4.4% will develop vision-threatening DR (VTDR). Currently, less than half of all patients with diabetes receive the recommended annual dilated eye exam and, of those diagnosed with VTDR, only 30% undergo timely treatment. New screening protocols are increasing screening effectiveness, however, even if every patient is screened, the majority of those at increased risk do not receive evidence-based follow-up care; a classic public health failure common to population-based screening. With expertise in health systems engineering and ophthalmology, the research team is uniquely suited to eliminate the root causes of this failure; resulting in a new, comprehensive care model designed to prevent blindness for the 8.9 million Americans with DR. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI)’s focus is on eliminating blindness by applying targeted care coordination for patients at increased risk for VTDR; ensuring they progress through the care path to treatment. However, two significant deficiencies weaken RCI’s ability to deliver effective care coordination. The first is insufficient capacity due to coordinating care for 35% of all patients, though less than 5% actually have VTDR. This derives from the low positive predictive value of the current system, based on a handheld electroretinography and pupillography device deployed in a primary care setting. The first aim is to improve the ability to classify a patient as low- risk for VTDR, thereby reducing the care coordination burden and improving quality and effectiveness. Aim 1: Improve the ability to accurately identify patients at increased risk for VTDR by including patient  health and demographic attributes in a machine learning based predictive algorithm for VTDR diagnosis.  Patient clusters will be identified (a) and used to create sub-population specific risk models (b). The second deficiency is the lack of adherence to follow-up and treatment after identification as increased risk for VTDR. Once a patient is identified as increased risk, the care coordination of the RCI DR program has averaged over five phone calls per patient to achieve follow-up with an eye care provider. The second aim is to identify and eliminate these barriers to coordinated care between patient and provider. Aim 2 Apply text analytics and simulation to improve access, compliance, cost, and equity by enhancing care coordination, from diagnosis to treatment, for patients at increased risk for VTDR. The application of data analytics and systems engineering methods to integrate and improve each critical component of the care path, access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment, will enable a paradigm shift in DR treatment. RCI’s platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model by delivering a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end solution for diabetic retinopathy care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic retinopathy (DR), affecting 8.9 million Americans, is the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans, yet, blindness is preventable in 90% of the cases with timely detection and treatment. To reach the 30 million adults living with diabetes in the US, the Retinal Care DR platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model via a first-of- its-kind end-to-end solution for DR care implementable in any care setting. This will be accomplished via the application of data analytics (machine learning and statistical analysis) and systems engineering (sentiment analysis and simulation) methods to integrate and improve each of the three critical components of the care path: access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment.",Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management,9679729,R41EY029917,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroretinography', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Service delivery model', 'Severities', 'Social Workers', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care costs', 'care providers', 'classification trees', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model design', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'pupillography', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'sociodemographics']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2019,219356,-0.007204011605952302

"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,9927810,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right to Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'programs', 'prospective', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,238522,0.016950839796847552
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9735365,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,302394,0.012251962536543428

"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,0.001735398588036766
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,0.021083769602032006
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9775421,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,384093,0.006734383586515753
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9637480,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,432969,0.01669843064519392
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9687065,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'computerized data processing', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,448622,0.027821408641327844
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,0.013051188052543551
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,0.03269116104493182
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,9819327,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,512304,0.005723273126803466
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Project Summary / Abstract Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. In many cases, patients suffering PNES events are prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and suffer unnecessary side effects. Alternatively, patients that are suspected to suffer PNES, but actually have epilepsy and are not treated with AEDs, are at risk of experiencing seizures and even sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a battery of costly tests. Thus, a critical gap in our clinical assessment of seizures, be it epileptic or psychogenic, is an accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or epilepsy. Towards developing this test, Evogen has developed an innovative informatic approach that incorporates all available clinical information and our protein biomarker approach to detect seizure using an artificial intelligence approach of machine learning. To confirm our previous results, Evogen proposes an epilepsy monitoring unit-based all-comers study which will collect both blood samples and clinical information from patients’ ES and PNES events. Protein biomarker concentrations will be determined and combined with clinical information using a machine learning approach to create a diagnostic algorithm that will provide a probabilistic score that a patient experienced an ES or PNES event. The test will have a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment of both ES and PNES. We believe this test will have an immediate impact on identifying which patients require EMU evaluation. Typically, one third of patients that visit the EMU for a definitive diagnosis suffer from PNES events and represent a large burden to the tertiary epilepsy centers. When patients are referred for EMU monitoring, they are sequentially put on a waiting list and infrequently is any triage used. Therefore, a test that can aid in routing patients with psychogenic events to the appropriate care will increase the accessibility for patients with a high probability of epilepsy. The work proposed here is the first step necessary to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation, a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA accreditation and bring the test to market. Project Narrative Differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizure is a substantially unmet medical need. Current tools to differentiate between epileptic seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have limited performance, high costs and limited availability. A diagnostic test that indicates if a patient recently experienced an epileptic seizure or psychogenic event would provide physicians with objective, actionable data that can result in improved clinical care, patient outcomes and healthcare system savings.",Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure,9846171,R43NS113724,"['Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'CCL8 gene', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Seasons', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wasting']",NINDS,"EVOGEN, INC.",R43,2019,562119,0.019827225606768875
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9685235,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,586227,0.02567133061956121
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9727956,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'classification trees', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,588500,-0.00948015339092737
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9774751,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2019,600683,-0.003557510510786265
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9738886,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,640937,0.028034810219383834
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9693333,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,646418,0.048563544782557325
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9713512,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,647706,0.006335928687678631
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9631317,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,656406,0.014529770028186976
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9722313,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,658069,0.041376335765983506
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients.

"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9643500,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Injury', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,694170,0.035112626820856044
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,9840429,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,739992,-0.041532660626085696
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants.

"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms.

"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9738159,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,763789,0.026071487611334335
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,0.003082008293021849
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9641499,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,855687,-0.02226043871055007
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9660167,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,892010,0.010507552725368238
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9567908,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2019,1747167,0.02059031214091706
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners.

"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9610301,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2018,44524,0.024551896955036033
"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use. Project Narrative There is growing pressure nationally, including from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), for critical assessments of the value provided by healthcare organizations. This proposal seeks to understand the costs of providing surgical care, specifically, the costs of surgical supplies for general surgery operations, which reflect a large but mutable component of expenditures. Further, this proposal seeks to introduce and evaluate a prospective intervention to reduce these expenses, the results of which will inform hospitals and providers about mechanisms they can use to reduce costs.",Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study,9552119,F32HS025079,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2018,71073,0.0303499106638952
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9436167,R36AG057949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Physical environment', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'burden of illness', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'segregation', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomic disadvantage']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2018,72343,0.001286526550100219
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes.

In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem).

"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9355893,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2018,92000,-0.007642131977978549
"Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions Project Summary Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize and critically assess bodies of evidence to produce a comprehensive unbiased assessment of what is known. As such, SRs are vital for evidence-based decision-making. However, given the pace of new research, the process of developing an SR remains too slow. One particularly time-consuming step in the process is citation screening, which requires manual review of thousands of abstracts to identify only a small number of relevant studies. Screening such large numbers of studies is necessary because systematic reviewers place a high priority on identifying all relevant studies to avoid bias. Innovative citation screening tools, which utilize text-mining and new sophisticated machine learning methods, represent one potential solution. Abstrackr (Brown University) and EPPI-Reviewer (University College London) are off- the-shelf, web-based citation screening tools designed to improve screening efficiency. Both programs utilize machine- learning techniques to semi-automate the screening process by modeling the probability that each citation will meet criteria for inclusion. This allows efficiency gains through screening prioritization and screening truncation. With screening prioritization, citations are organized for screening from highest to lowest likelihood of inclusion. This allows earlier retrieval of full-text articles and facilitates workflow planning. Organizing citations by likelihood of inclusion also allows reviewers the option of truncating the screening process when remaining citations fall below a certain threshold. While promising, existing studies have predominantly been performed by computer scientists testing individual tools or comparing different modeling algorithms (e.g., various classifiers). To date, no studies have performed a direct comparison of citation screening tools. Similarly, although automatically excluding citations that fall below particular thresholds could substantively improve efficiency, adoption has been low due to concerns that relevant studies could be missed. However, how often studies would be missed and how important such omissions would be remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will (1) Compare screening efficiency for two citation-screening tools, Abstrackr and EPPI-reviewer, and (2) Characterize the potential impact of using thresholds to exclude low probability studies automatically. To address aim 1, using citations from 3 large and 6 small completed evidence reports, we will compare Abstrackr to EPPI-Reviewer for citation screening. Using screening prioritization, we will assess what proportion of articles must be screened to identify all included studies (e.g., to achieve 100% sensitivity). For Aim 2, we will explore the potential impact of excluding all citations that fall below particular thresholds during the screening process. We will also assess to what extent missing these studies would alter report conclusions. By characterizing potential efficiency gains from new, innovative, and widely accessible tools, this project can facilitate wider adoption by evidence based practice centers seeking to speed systematic review production. Project Narrative Systematic reviews provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of a body of literature and are vital for timely, evidence-based decision-making. However, development of systematic reviews remains too slow, with one particularly time-consuming step being citation screening, in which thousands of research abstracts are manually reviewed to identify a small number of relevant studies. By testing potential gains in citation screening efficiency offered by two innovative, widely-accessible machine- learning tools (Abstrackr and EPPI–Reviewer), and determining if automatically excluding studies to improve speed compromises report conclusions, we hope to enable more rapid production of systematic reviews to inform clinicians and policy-makers and promote high quality, evidence-based patient care.",Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions,9435231,R03HS025859,[' '],AHRQ,ECRI INSTITUTE,R03,2018,95324,-0.034408031283148205
"EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation Project Summary The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is one of the most important pieces of federal legislation governing emergency care. EMTALA was passed in 1986 in response to highly publicized incidents of inadequate, delayed or denied treatment of uninsured patients by emergency departments (EDs). The intent of EMTALA was to prevent EDs from practicing patient “dumping,” defined as turning away or transferring patients without authorization or initiation of appropriate stabilizing measures based on their ability to pay. EMTALA requires that all ED patients receive a timely medical screening evaluation, stabilization of identified emergent conditions, and, when indicated, transfer to another facility for higher level of care. EMTALA is an actively enforced law. EMTALA empowers the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to authorize EMTALA investigations and grants substantial punitive powers. Since 2005, 43% of U.S. hospitals have been investigated and 27% cited for EMTALA violation. There is 5-fold variation in rates of EMTALA citations across CMS regions. It is unknown whether this variation reflects arbitrary differences in reporting, investigation and enforcement of alleged violations, or true differences in quality of care. Little is known about characteristics of hospitals cited for EMTALA violations or how facility response to citation impacts access to care for patients served by the institution. To evaluate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality we propose to (1) create a longitudinal dataset of EMTALA citations 2005-2016 linked to hospital characteristics and quality of care measures, (2) use multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the associations between facility-level features (e.g., payer mix, hospital quality, ED volume, urban/rural status) and citation for an EMTALA violation, and (3) survey hospital administrators to explore facility response to EMTALA citations. We will conduct an exploratory survey of administrators at California hospitals with recent EMTALA citations (2014-2016, n=96) to characterize and describe operational changes following citations. We expect facilities to respond to EMTALA citations with a variety of measures including modification of on-call specialist coverage, overhauling policies and procedures, educating providers, auditing procedural compliance, and instituting other important but resource intensive measures including hiring additional ED providers, opening beds, or upgrading facilities. Understanding whether EMTALA citations disproportionately impact facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citation will improve understanding of how EMTALA impacts access to emergency care for vulnerable populations. EDs are an essential part of the U.S. safety-net, and the provider of last resort for millions of underserved low-income and minority patients, making this issue of particular importance to the AHRQ priority populations. Project Narrative The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is the most important federal legislation governing emergency care, as EMTALA citations can result in CMS provider agreement termination and lead to hospital closure. Currently there are no published studies examining predictors of EMTALA citation or how facilities respond to citation. Understanding whether EMTALA enforcement disproportionately impacts facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citations will help to elucidate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality.","EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation",9530337,R03HS025281,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R03,2018,100000,0.031128476245608702
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9504868,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2018,131517,0.007810569160542205
"Characterizing Prehospital Delay and Outcomes in Patients Treated for Potential Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department Delayed treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be a matter of life or death. Each 30-minute increase in treatment delay raises the one-year mortality rate by 7.5%. The median patient prehospital delay time in presentation to the emergency department (ED) is more than two hours and has ranged from 1-24 hours, raising the risk of one year mortality up to an astounding 360% across studies. Emergent reperfusion targets (<90 minutes) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been largely met with no resultant decrease in mortality suggesting that prehospital, rather than in-hospital delay, is contributing to poorer patient outcomes. In addition, ACS is associated with multiple debilitating symptoms, impaired functional status, repeat visits to the ED, and frequent healthcare utilization but inadequate attention has been paid to the relationship between prehospital delay (defined as time of symptom onset to arrival in the ED) and these patient outcomes. The objective of this secondary data analysis is to identify multiple, theory-based factors associated with prehospital delay and examine the association of prehospital delay with the outcomes of healthcare utilization and persistent symptoms. The sample includes patients presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered an evaluation for possible ACS. Data from the prospective Think Symptoms study, whose main aim was to characterize the influence of gender on symptoms during ACS, will be used for analyses. The dataset includes a multiethnic sample of 1064 patients (400 women and 664 men) presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered a cardiac evaluation. Data were collected in four academic and one non- academic medical center in four regions of the US. The dataset is unique in that it includes patients ruled-in for ACS and ruled-out for ACS as well as symptom data collected at presentation to triage, in the ED examination room, and one and six months following discharge. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) Identify predictors of prehospital delay for potential ACS by final diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS) including patient factors, event factors, and transportation factors; 2) Determine the association between prehospital delay and one and six-month health care utilization and symptom outcomes by diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS); and 3) Determine the relative contribution of patient, event, and transportation factors on patient outcomes attributable to prehospital delay. Multilinear and logistic regression modeling adjusting for relevant covariates will be used to address aims 1 and 2. Path analyses, a form of statistical equation modeling will be used to address aim 3. This novel work will provide models of patient factors influencing delay that will fill knowledge gaps and aid in the design of patient-centered interventions to reduce prehospital delay for ACS and improve patient outcomes. The outcome of this novel secondary analyses of data from the Think Symptoms study will be to advance science by providing data on the relationships between factors influencing prehospital delay and the potential impact on post-discharge patient outcomes. This analysis also has the potential to improve patient care since we will use our findings to develop new sex and age appropriate clinical interventions to improve outcomes by reducing treatment-seeking delay and improving symptom management for individuals at risk for, or previously diagnosed with, ACS.",Characterizing Prehospital Delay and Outcomes in Patients Treated for Potential Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department,9588737,R21HL140277,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency medical service', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Management', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Statistical Models', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Triage', 'Undifferentiated', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'acute symptom', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care seeking', 'critical care nursing', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'impaired functional status', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'persistent symptom', 'prospective', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'success', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'theories']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,140851,0.0044634623626169335
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial.

"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work and improve the capacity of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care patterns across hospitals using electronic health record data, and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better sepsis prevention and treatment strategies.  ","Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care",9532741,K08HS025008,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2018,149472,0.025095575310128303
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials. Project Narrative  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. This study will test and validate algorithms for the identification of SLE from EHR data and thus will help provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.",Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data,9536683,R21AR072263,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Flare', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Populations at Risk', 'Progressive Disease', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'economic cost', 'health care settings', 'health record', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation']",NIAMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,173800,0.053598489357988735
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9599192,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2018,174917,0.006583573031764722
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9537252,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,178606,0.02363594488879937
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9566983,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,187483,0.015386082360681752
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9538699,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,190216,0.04539784571824888
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9505570,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2018,195205,-0.005930383335695282
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9520862,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2018,201825,0.01040411044057954
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration Hypertension (HTN) affects 73 million Americans, with an annual hospitalization cost of $113 billion/year. Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in patients with poorly controlled BP.",HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration,9461180,R43HL140624,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adjudication', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'college', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'success', 'system architecture', 'theories', 'treatment optimization', 'vector']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R43,2018,224090,0.004994537969092419
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9536656,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,246106,0.026970538733218027
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,0.03623924018746974

screening. The pediatric population is underserved, with fundamental research and understanding of pediatric  sepsis  syndromes  lagging  behind  that  of  the  adult  population.  The  proposed  work  will  develop  machine  learning sepsis predictions on the highly heterogeneous pediatric population, by combining multi-­task learning  methods with expert clinical knowledge of how pediatric sepsis presentation is dependent on age and on pre-­ existing  conditions.  The  multi-­task  learning  approach  will  use  age  or  comorbidities  to  define  “tasks,”  each  one  associated  with  prediction  on  a  particular  subpopulation,  and  then  link  the  learning  process  together  between  tasks. Research Questions: Which methods of using these task-­defining parameters are most effective? How  can  we  most  effectively  learn  the  degree  of  similarity  between  pediatric  subpopulations  and  leverage  this  to  improve classification performance? Prior Work: InSight was originally developed to predict sepsis and septic  shock from adult EHR data. After retraining on pediatric cases, in preliminary experiments with a retrospective  set  of  pediatric  (2-­17  yr)  inpatient  encounters  (n  =  11,127;;  103  [0.9%]  severely  septic),  at  the  University  of  California  San  Francisco  (UCSF),  InSight  achieved  an  AUROC  0.912  and  0.727  for  the  detection  and  4-­hour  pre-­onset  prediction  of  sepsis.  This  performance  can  be  improved  for  better  pediatric  sepsis  prediction.  Specific  Aims:  To  empirically  evaluate  different  learning  schemes  using  age  with  and  without  multi-­task  methods,  within  the  UCSF  pediatric  severe  sepsis  data  set  (Aim  1).  To  exploit  an  expert-­proposed  network  graph  structure  for  comorbidity-­described  pediatric  subpopulations  that  provides  superior  predictive  performance  over  naïve  methods  and  graphs,  both  for  the  overall  population  and  for  underserved  subpopulations  (Aim  2).  Methods:  We  propose  to  use  multi-­task  methods  that  penalize  deviations  between  classifiers  on  neighboring  tasks  and  that  iteratively  learn  the  strength  of  these  links.  These  methods  will  be  compared with total task independence, or passing age into classifier training as an ordinary input. Criteria for  Success:  Success  will  be  shown  by  4-­hour  pre-­onset  AUROC  gains  of  0.02  (overall  population)  and  0.03  for  the previously weakest of three age subpopulations (2-­5, 6-­12, and 13-­17 yrs;; 4-­hour pre-­onset prediction, p <  0.05, McNemar’s test, 4-­fold cross-­validation). The best structure for mapping similarities between comorbidity  tasks will improve the overall AUROC by 0.03 (p < 0.05) and by 0.07 for ≥ 2 comorbidity subpopulations of ≥ 100 patients (p < 0.05). Outcome: These improvements will enable InSight to deliver strong sepsis predictive  performance across the widely heterogeneous pediatric population.         Narrative  Pediatric  sepsis  can  be  difficult  to  diagnose,  in  part  because the  pediatric  population  is  highly  heterogeneous;;  clinical  decision  support  (CDS)  systems  have  the  potential  to  aid  in  the  diagnosis  and  prediction  of  pediatric  sepsis, if the underlying diversity of the pediatric population is correctly addressed. We will develop a machine-­ learning-­based  sepsis  CDS  system  by  using  multi-­task  learning  techniques  to  define  a  set  of  “tasks,”  each  corresponding  to  predicting  severe  sepsis  in  a  clinically  distinct  subpopulation  of  pediatric  inpatients,  together  with  a  set  of  inter-­task  connections  that  share  information  between  similar  subpopulations.    This  will  enable  improved sepsis prediction across the widely heterogeneous and underserved pediatric patient population.     ",Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9476980,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,300000,0.05056401736211709
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9540043,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,304104,0.012251962536543428
"A computational approach to early sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the performance of InSight, a machine-learning- based sepsis screening system, in situations of limited training data from the target clinical site. The proposed work will make possible prospective clinical deployments to sites which are smaller or lack clinical data repositories, by significantly reducing the amount of training data necessary down to a few weeks of clinical observation. Classically, a machine-learning-based system like InSight requires complete retraining for each new clinical setting, in turn requiring a new and large collection of data from each target deployment site. We will circumvent this requirement via transfer learning techniques, which transfer knowledge acquired previously in a source clinical setting to a new, target setting. Research Questions: Which transfer learning methods and paired classification algorithms are most suitable for use with InSight, requiring minimal target-site training data while maintaining strong performance? Are these methods and algorithms robust across the several common sepsis-spectrum definitions? Prior Work: We have developed InSight using the MIMIC-III retrospective data set, on which it attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. We have also conducted pilot transfer learning  ≥ experiments in a different clinical task, mortality forecasting, in which transfer learning yields a 10-fold reduction in the amount of target-site training data required to achieve AUROC 0.80. Specific Aims: Aim 1 - to implement and assess side-by-side four diverse transfer learning methods for a retrospective clinical sepsis prediction task, where the source data set is MIMIC-III and the simulated clinical target is a data set drawn from UCSF. Aim 2 - to determine which among the best methods from Aim 1 also provide robust performance when applied to two additional sepsis-spectrum gold standards. Methods: We will prepare implementations of transfer learning methods which use instance transfer, residual learning and/or feature augmentation, kernel length scale transfer, and feature transfer. We will test these methods with applicable classifiers on subsets of the UCSF set, using cross-validation and quantifying discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The best method/classifier pairs will require no more than 30 examples of septic patients from the target set and attain AUROC superiorities of 0.05 in 0- and 4-hour pre-onset sepsis prediction/detection, relative to the best tested alternative screening systems (Aim 1). The top three pairs will then be tested for robustness to gold standard choice, using septic shock (0- and 4-hour) and SIRS-based sepsis (0-hour) gold standards; in these tests, at least one pair must again attain 0.05 margin of superiority in AUROC versus the alternative screening systems (Aim 2). Future Directions: The results of these experiments will enable InSight to be robustly deployed to diverse clinical sites, yielding high performance without the need for extensive target-site data acquisition. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing relevant information. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but accessing its full strength requires re-training with retrospective data from each target clinical site. We will use transfer learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of target-site training data required by InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for sepsis prediction, and empirically evaluate several such methods on a patient data set, using three different sepsis-related gold standards.",A computational approach to early sepsis detection,9557664,R43TR002221,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'prospective', 'screening', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,310782,0.020327998620101317
"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, “HindSight”, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating clinicians’ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSight’s predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (≥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labeler’s performance. Labeling AUROC ≥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1’s labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,0.021083769602032006
"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Start Program', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,349320,0.015308438087875811

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,0.021175141254432567
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9644117,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,397399,0.006734383586515753
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9534365,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,449751,0.0349815031223205
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,-0.009048272368532907
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9547370,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,585626,-0.00948015339092737
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,0.02567133061956121
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9548987,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2018,620106,-0.003557510510786265
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients. The proposed work will have a significant impact on clinical management of FH patients.",EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia,9490424,R01HL135879,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Awareness', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoprotein (a)', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Xanthomas', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care providers', 'case-based', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'epidemiology study', 'evaluation/testing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'point of care', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,653490,0.032366235654480935
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9502383,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,658069,0.041376335765983506
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly.

"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9463552,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,694555,0.014529770028186976
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,0.003082008293021849
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants. All of this work will be pursued with our eMERGE III Network colleagues the goal of improving the quality of the health care we deliver.",Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy,9515026,U01HG008666,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Appendicitis', 'Archives', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Sequence', 'Boston', 'Budgets', 'CYP3A5 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Costs and Benefits', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Legal Obligations', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Mosaicism', 'Narcotic Addiction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'PTEN gene', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Pyloric Stenosis', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'follow-up', 'gene panel', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'patient oriented', 'pleiotropism', 'preference', 'primary pulmonary hypertension', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2018,855289,0.0018281883444191507
"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses.

"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"Evaluation of dynamic strategies of cancer care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In making the most important decisions for cancer care, clinicians naturally consider their patients' evolving characteristics and risks factors and tailor the treatments or diagnostic tests accordingly. In other words, they consider dynamic treatment strategies that depend on the evolution of one or more time-dependent covariates (e.g. functional status, frailty, new comorbidities) as opposed to static treatment strategies which do not. Despite the clinical relevance of dynamic treatment strategies, most research continues to compare static strategies. This is because, in part, randomized clinical trials comparing dynamic strategies can be particularly expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Additionally, observational studies of dynamic strategies require specific methods because even in the absence of unmeasured confounding, conventional estimates fail to have a causal interpretation when (i) there exists a measured time-varying prognostic factor that also predicts subsequent treatment, and (ii) past treatment predicts subsequent prognostic factor level. This treatment- confounder feedback is pervasive in biomedical research. This application's broad objective is to create an innovative research program that integrates data from diverse sources such as electronic medical records, administrative claims, epidemiologic cohorts (and in the future wearable health technology and patient portals) with advanced epidemiological methods to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery and create publicly available analytic tools to accelerate discovery and support a more strategic delivery of cancer care. The specific aims involve training in open-source programming, data science and advanced epidemiological methods. These skills will be used to develop three projects that will use different sources of data (a traditional epidemiological cohort, a linkage of tumor registries with claims and electronic medical records) to address questions on prevention, surveillance and treatment of cancer:  • What is the best dynamic strategy for colorectal cancer screening?  • What is the best dynamic strategy for bladder cancer surveillance?  • What is the best dynamic strategy of treatment for prostate cancer patients with a PSA-only relapse? These projects will serve as a backbone to develop and fine tune the specific methods required to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery: the g-methods. Specifically, this application will focus on the application and dissemination of Marginal Structural Models and the parametric g-formula for clinical cancer research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal addresses the systematic application and dissemination of cutting-edge methods (g- methods) for causal inference to clinical cancer research using complex sources of data. G-methods are particularly useful for answering clinical questions where treatments, patient characteristics and outcomes change over time (which is virtually always the case). By tailoring these methods to cancer research and developing open-source analytic platforms, we plan to spread their use across the scientific community and ultimately benefit patient care.",Evaluation of dynamic strategies of cancer care,9314154,K99CA207730,"['Address', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Androgens', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Observational Study', 'Orphan', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance Status', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Vertebral column', 'academic program', 'administrative database', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'case-based', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'relational database', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'sound', 'surveillance strategy', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'tumor', 'tumor registry', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2017,137137,-0.039088284296688196
"Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data The recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical care medicine. The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time-critical and frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal, non-specific, age-dependent constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events. Currently available EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus-based guidelines criteria have poor sensitivity/specificity and/or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability. Recent studies show that, in general, sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common, either in the form of false positives or false negatives (e.g. alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis). As a result such tools are, at best, modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and, in infants, can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns. We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in sensitivity/specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) operating at a clinician-specified level of risk. This will require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models (rules, natural language processing) embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines, pediatric critical care clinician expertise, and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine learning algorithms. Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase 1 NIH research grant focused on the use of advanced ontological models combined with “big data” predictive analytics/machine learning (ML) techniques over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS. We demonstrated an AUC of 98% and PPV in excess of 85% for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of 15,811. We will leverage these results to establish exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis/septic shock. Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes. Our product development concept will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows, combined with a clinician-centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and EMR data sources. Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability, compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital, that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality in both critical and non-critical care settings. Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics/antivirals used in hospitals, one-third of children who die in U.S. tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real-time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome.

"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9280871,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,149851,0.045964420902114285
"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work and improve the capacity of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care patterns across hospitals using electronic health record data, and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better sepsis prevention and treatment strategies.  ","Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care",9385491,K08HS025008,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2017,151416,0.025095575310128303

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9325317,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,178606,0.02363594488879937
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.015386082360681752
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9322197,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,190216,0.04539784571824888
"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials. Project Narrative  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. This study will test and validate algorithms for the identification of SLE from EHR data and thus will help provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.",Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data,9375416,R21AR072263,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Expenditure', 'Flare', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Populations at Risk', 'Progressive Disease', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data resource', 'economic cost', 'health record', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation']",NIAMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,208395,0.053598489357988735
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,0.017845769042756164
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care Project Summary Value-based healthcare implementation relies on understanding risk. 1 Early models, such as Medicare Advantage, use annual measures of risk under a risk adjustment factor (RAF) to offer financial incentive to payers and hospitals to work together. 2 More advanced models, such as bundled payments, target the periods of greatest quality variability, specifically episodes of care such as joint replacement, oncology diagnosis, and cardiac procedures. In these episodes, many types of providers, from hospitals to outpatient physical therapists, need to work together to reduce rates of complication and readmission. Risk levels are used to adjust payment for payer and providers and to determine which patients require additional resources in the hospital, clinic, or home. Unfortunately, existing risk models lack key features needed for episode-based care, which requires both financial alignment and accurate and immediate information to adjust clinical resources for a given case. 3 4 A better model would include all conditions relevant to an episode rather than just chronic conditions, addition of social determinants, and an automated approach to retrieve the information in hours rather than months. Thus, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I program includes the following Specific Aims: 1. Create the phenotyping components required to define an accurate and comprehensive model  of episode-based risk, including: (i) extract clinical and social features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP), (ii) map concepts including social features to an ontology  that will support normalized data use, (iii) build a feature vector for each record that can be  used to feed a risk model that accounts for relevant clinical and social risk 2. Validate the phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for 10,000 patients In this research program, Phase I will tackle the most difficult challenges, including leveraging narrative text to recognize time-labeled social and clinical features influencing an episode of care. Success criteria will be accurate recognition of key underlying features that have not been available in risk models to date. Phase II will build upon the validated technology to create an episode-based risk model run on narrative and discrete clinical data and tested against actual patient outcomes. Success criteria will be a validated episode-based risk model to support value-based contracting and value-based clinical care. Project Narrative Advanced payment models in United States healthcare rely on accurate assessment of risk and quality. While quality has gained broad attention, risk models remain outdated and poorly suited to advanced payment models. CapsicoHealth proposes an effort to redefine risk models used for episode-based payments, using data sets across the continuum of care and clinical and social determinants of care that have previously been unavailable in computable form. If successful, this effort will impact financial and clinical approaches to value-based healthcare and significantly increase the chance that national efforts to improve cost and quality will be effective.",Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care,9464424,R43LM012798,"['Attention', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complication', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Reform', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Insurance', 'Label', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'concept mapping', 'cost', 'feeding', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'interest', 'oncology', 'payment', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'social', 'success', 'vector']",NLM,"CAPSICOHEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,222588,0.010901585772331416
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9322355,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,246106,0.026970538733218027
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9251814,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,300000,0.05056401736211709
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9355417,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,302394,0.012251962536543428
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9254614,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,377260,0.021175141254432567
"Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death—who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources—and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population. Project Narrative Despite major advances in palliative care for patients with specific diseases, we know little about how to deliver palliative interventions `upstream'—earlier in the disease trajectory for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We will apply advanced predictive modeling techniques (`machine learning') to identify older patients in a primary care setting who would benefit most from palliative care: those whose complex interplay of chronic conditions puts them at high risk of near-term death. Building on our team's strong infrastructure for clinical trials in palliative care, we will enroll the highest-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care.",Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults,9565691,R56AG055728,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Area Under Curve', 'Awareness', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Geriatrics', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-12', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cost', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'trial comparing']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R56,2017,382595,-0.006192771090627043
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5 n psychiatry, clinical judgment has been the predominant method of diagnosis. The `gold standard” for clinical research is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). The SCID-5 promotes reliability, but its validity is questionable. There is growing recognition that biomarkers can be used to identify more homogeneous patient populations, but there is substantial phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia even in identical twins. In the absence of symptom data, biomarkers alone are unlikely to yield a clinical diagnosis.  In a past SBIR project, TeleSage Inc. successfully converted the paper SCID into a web-based software program. The NetSCID-5 is now widely used in research. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the goal of “turning clinical care networks into centers for research” (Insel, Director's Blog, 2012) and furthering the RDoC initiative, we need a means of gathering rigorous diagnostic data in routine clinical care. This software must (a) require minimal clinician time, (b) allow clinics to bill according to the current DSM-5 categories, and (c) be able to gather the large amount of data necessary to inform a broad research agenda including machine learning techniques. TeleSage proposes to develop a self-report diagnostic assessment that satisfies both immediate clinical needs and broader research goals: the “Screening Interview for Diagnosis” or SID.  TeleSage has worked with an expert panel including Dr. Michael First, the primary author of the SCID- 5, iteratively developing and testing self-report items. Based on expert panel review and cognitive interviewing, we identified a final set of 661 unique self-report, Likert-scale items covering all of the individual sub-symptoms described within each of the SCID criteria. TeleSage has also created a behavioral health PORTAL that includes the NetSCID-5, IRT/CAT item administration, randomization, and longitudinal reporting capabilities. The PORTAL exchanges data and reports with several EHRs including the NetSmart EHR system.  This Direct-to-Phase II application aims to create the SID, which will (a) reside on our existing secure web PORTAL, (b) administer simple Likert-scale self-report items, (c) generate DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnoses for billing, (d) use minimal clinician time, (e) pull pre-defined data fields from the EHR (e.g. family history, demographic, and biomarker data), (f) be able to add new self-report items for exploration, (g) integrate with machine learning tools, and (h) send raw data and interpretive reports to EHR systems. Because of these features, we believe that the SID has the potential to be used widely by both clinicians and researchers.  The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5 and to support RDoC. The SID product must be commercially successful and useful both in routine clinical care and research. The SID is intended to facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data, a nosology that is more analogous to those found in other fields of medicine. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) represents the current diagnostic gold standard in behavioral health and yields much more reliable diagnoses than the unstructured patient interviews that predominate in clinical settings; however, the full SCID-5 is a lengthy and complex paper-and-pencil instrument that takes approximately 90 minutes to administer and is thus seldom used outside of clinical research settings. We want to create a new, self-report software tool that will save clinicians time relative to the paper SCID, significantly reduce diagnostic error rates, greatly increase the reliability of diagnoses in routine clinical care, and integrate seamlessly into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems: the Screening Inventory for Diagnosis (SID). The SID is a self-report, computer-adaptive diagnostic assessment, based on easy-to- understand, five-point Likert-scale items. The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5, support RDoC, and facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data.","Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5",9255772,R44MH108177,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Brain scan', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'data exchange', 'disease classification', 'epigenetic marker', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'instrument', 'mental health center', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptom cluster', 'tool', 'usability', 'web portal']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R44,2017,433630,0.012390518296838208
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9319536,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2017,449993,0.0349815031223205
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9284760,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,516245,0.048563544782557325
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9323511,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,536041,0.0035147554841964083
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9283910,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,544529,-0.009048272368532907
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9247214,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,598066,0.02567133061956121
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9421755,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,601139,-0.00948015339092737
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9331533,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2017,623596,-0.003557510510786265
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9357725,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,687081,0.041376335765983506

The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9207492,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749226,0.014529770028186976
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9278036,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2017,1755747,0.02059031214091706

"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use. Project Narrative There is growing pressure nationally, including from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), for critical assessments of the value provided by healthcare organizations. This proposal seeks to understand the costs of providing surgical care, specifically, the costs of surgical supplies for general surgery operations, which reflect a large but mutable component of expenditures. Further, this proposal seeks to introduce and evaluate a prospective intervention to reduce these expenses, the results of which will inform hospitals and providers about mechanisms they can use to reduce costs.",Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study,9259659,F32HS025079,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2016,63755,0.0303499106638952
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9166164,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,149836,0.045964420902114285

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,0.02363594488879937
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9147610,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,190216,0.04539784571824888
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary As United States healthcare seeks to address inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost, data and technology have become central to all suggested approaches. With newly available electronic health data and massive growth in processing power, the hardest challenges in using clinical data are becoming clear. Big data holds the potential to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value-based payment models. However, it also creates challenges in discriminating accurate data from inaccurate or incomplete information. One of the greatest areas of data inaccuracy is the patient phenotype, or clinical description of the patient. Every clinical decision support tool, population health management system, and payment reform product relies on accurate electronic patient descriptions as its source data. But, the descriptions are not accurate, most notably in terms of completeness and granularity. Recall often falls below 50% in describing a patient’s medical conditions, such as heart failure and cancer. Detailed descriptions such as low ejection fraction heart failure or stage III breast cancer, needed for downstream analytics, are lacking in the discrete record. Poor data puts care delivery, payment reform, and population health efforts in peril. The time is right for technology to proactively define the clinical phenotype from source data, without reliance on current manual approaches. This will necessitate overcoming challenges in harmonizing discrepant narrative and discrete data, inferring when a characteristic such as cough is a primary condition versus symptom of another condition, and screening noise from signal in robust narrative text. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will include the following specific aims: 1. Create the components required to define an accurate and comprehensive clinical phenotype,  including: (i) extract problem, medication, procedure, and lab features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP) and ontologic mapping, (ii) build a large knowledge database  of associated clinical conditions, and (iii) assess extracted features against the knowledge  database to accurately distinguish symptoms from diseases and surface relevant active diseases  in a candidate problem list. 2. Validate the clinical phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for  10,000 patients The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create an automated, accurate, and robust clinical phenotyping engine to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value- based payment models. Project Narrative Individual and global care improvement demands accurate phenotypes. This type of clinical phenotyping is extremely challenging, requiring full clinical data and advanced semantic technologies to develop a longitudinal patient map. The approach, if successful, offers an opportunity to empower national efforts to improve outcomes and reduce costs.",Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare,9199039,R43LM012357,"['Address', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congresses', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'discrete data', 'empowered', 'experience', 'falls', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'payment', 'personalized care', 'population health', 'screening', 'success', 'support tools']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2016,222977,0.017583095576366413
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,0.017845769042756164
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9144770,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,246106,0.026970538733218027
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9050675,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,300000,0.05056401736211709
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,9025565,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2016,409330,-0.0242518982505731
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9120230,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2016,425000,0.0349815031223205
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.            ",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9094161,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2016,652772,-0.003557510510786265
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).            ",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9103405,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Boxing', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staff Work Load', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,656467,0.041376335765983506
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9029396,R01GM117622,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,662537,0.02567133061956121
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,8978947,K99LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2015,83160,0.040981295575226444
"Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit. The disposition plan of patients who visit an ED is to be directly discharged home, placed in observation care, or admitted to the hospital. There is mounting concern that recent increased use of observation care may also subject patients to a rapid diagnostic regiment with unknown utility. As older patients continue to rely on the ED and hospitals for their care, the potential for treatment that is not geriatric-oriented and results in undesirable outcomes shortly after discharge is high. A negative outcome within 7-days of discharge from an acute care encounter is temporally related to the visit and has important policy implications. The goal of this research program is to identify patients at risk for a short-term negative outcome, defined as either an inpatient admission or death, within 7 days of discharge from their acute care encounter. The proposal will utilize a randomly selected sample of 5% Medicare Claims data, which amounts to 2.4 million beneficiaries, of which patients age > 65 years who visit the ED in 2012 will be analyzed. The multi-disciplinary project team includes experts in health services research, geriatrics, emergency medicine, administrative claims data research, and statistics. In Aim 1, the study will assess predictors of ED disposition (discharge or observation care) following the ED visit. The team will then conduct a stratified analysis to identify predictors of negative outcomes following discharge from observation care (Aim 2) or the ED (Aim 3). The proposal will assess the association between two sets of primary predictors, ED discharge diagnosis codes developed by the PI as well as the recently created Medicare Chronic Conditions, and outcomes. Additional variables will include patient demographics, comorbidities, facility characteristics, prior inpatient utilization, skilled nursing facility usage, and community demographics. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, assessment for similarities and collinearity between the predictors, and hierarchical random effects logistic regression models pertaining to each Aim. All project aims have sufficient power to complete the analyses. The proposed study will identify characteristics of patients at risk for negative short-term outcomes following acute care encounters and will (1) provide population-level national data to understand negative outcomes following discharge, (2) serve as a foundation for future work in developing a post-discharge intervention that will reduce these events, and (3) help ED managers, geriatricians, and health policy experts develop national guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Endstage kidney disease, the complete failure of the kidneys, is one of the most pressing medical problems of the developed world. Currently, the best treatment for endstage kidney disease is kidney transplantation, but the number of donor organs are limited, subjecting patients to hemodialysis and in many cases further complications and an early death. We have developed a new method that could be used to grow embryonic kidneys in the laboratory. These kidneys could then be transplanted to support the kidney function of the patient.",Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare,8926346,R03AG047862,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elderly', 'Embryo', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'System', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cost', 'demographics', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'male', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2015,91665,0.014116393294040446
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.            ",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9026947,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,104080,0.026970538733218027
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD.

Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8934087,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,145229,0.014113032624988099
"HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our research is focused on the use of advanced ontological models as a foundation for computerized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems that link hospitalized patient data routinely captured in electronic medical records (EMRs) with medical knowledge to effectively influence timely awareness and treatment choices by clinicians. Our phase 1 goal is to demonstrate how our advanced CDS technology has the potential to improve preventable mortality outcomes associated with sepsis in ICU patients. We distinguish two types of CDS algorithms available today for detecting and/or predicting sepsis using EMR data: 1) evidence-based ""knowledge-driven"" detection algorithms; and 2) data-driven ""predictive"" algorithms based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Recent studies indicate currently available CDS tools do not reduce risk of death in hospitalized patients. We believe this may be because diseases such as sepsis are time-sensitive, complex syndromes and also due to the challenges of computerized reuse of unstructured EMR data. Our sepsis ontology models this complexity to: a) provide enhanced knowledge-driven sepsis risk- stratified cohort classifications that help guide interventions; b) support accurate natural language processing (NLP) of free text clinical notes to enhance real-time sepsis risk detection; and c) improve the accuracy of data- driven prediction models when used in conjunction with ML training algorithms. Our CDS is based on proprietary cluster computing technology we call ""VFusion"" designed to efficiently deal with the generation and practical use of large, application domain-specific ontologies. Our sepsis ontology employs a family of upper level ontologies, combined with granular evidence-based domain ontologies, configurable rule sets (e.g. first order logic-based), and required components of reference terminologies. Our research will use openly available ICU patient data to establish statistical detection/prediction performance metrics using this ontology in 2 modes of use: 1) as a knowledge-based screening tool to detect subtle signs of sepsis in individualized hospitalized patients; 2) used in conjunction with ML to improve data-driven predictive performance. We will measure specificity/sensitivity, and positive/negative predictive power of our hybrid ontology-based technology to demonstrate dramatically improved performance over existing CDS algorithms. In Phase II we plan a retrospective demonstration with a much larger sample of patients to include non-ICU patients in collaboration with a major healthcare system. Our product vision is an early inpatient sepsis detection algorithm with high accuracy embodied as a ""plug-in application"" compatible with any modern EMR platform in use at a client hospital effective in both ICU and non-ICU care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Even with the advent of powerful, new computer medical record technologies used in hospitals, the risk of death has not been reduced in hospitalized patients. The goal of this research effort is to combine medical record systems with advanced cognitive technologies that are commonly used today in products such as the iPhone ""Siri"" to improve clinician awareness and decisions that will dramatically reduce preventable mortality. Our initial use case will be the management of sepsis--=the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units in hospitals                ",HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA,9046860,R43LM012291,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mortality Determinants', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2015,149100,0.045699913098686505

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.                ",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9044236,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,190216,0.04539784571824888
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8804856,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.0019363473629729947
"Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources. Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose target to enable cost-effective implementation of resource-intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high-risk individuals.  Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs. Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations. However, it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost-effective.  One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patients' functional status, social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents, from which it is difficult to extract. Furthermore, the amount of information about any single patient i the medical record is enormous, and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis.  In the proposed project investigators will combine two novel technologies - natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic - to help circumvent these challenges to build a high-accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes. Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow to greatly increasing the number of factors / variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control, and ultimately improve their accuracy. Consequently this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real-life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose, decrease the rate of diabetes complications, improve the patients' quality of life and help control the rising costs of healthcare.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lowering blood glucose of patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life and reduce healthcare costs, but may be more difficult for some patients than others. Patients who have particularly high barriers to blood glucose control could benefit from extra resources, but it can be challenging to identify them in advance. In this projec the investigators will combine advanced computational technologies including artificial intelligence and natural language processing to identify patients with diabetes at high risk for difficulty lowering blood glucose to help make commitment of additional resources cost-effective.                ",Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure,8902473,R41DK105612,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Epidemic', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Failure', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'combinatorial', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional status', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'social']",NIDDK,LP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,R41,2015,223336,0.012978607757767876
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted. Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8906937,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,297811,0.029897421280811444
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.                ",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,8798027,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,299888,0.05056401736211709
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8915498,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2015,419993,0.0349815031223205
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8830936,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2015,494533,-0.0242518982505731
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8875053,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,531035,0.005969110630314931
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.            ",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,8964138,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'natural language', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,608132,0.0035147554841964083
"Worcester Heart Attack Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This population-based study proposes to continue the examination of changing long-term trends in the descriptive epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and out-of hospital deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in residents of the Worcester, MA, metropolitan area. The specific objectives of this population- based study are to examine contemporary (2013 and 2015), as compared with prior (1975-2011), trends in the annual incidence and attack rates of AMI, hospital and post-discharge survival rates, management practices, and out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD. To accomplish these and several additional secondary study objectives, this investigation will be carried out in the 11 acute care general hospitals providing care for residents of central Massachusetts. All new (incident) and recurrent episodes of definite AMI occurring in greater Worcester residents during 2013 and 2015 will be identified from discharge diagnostic printouts obtained from all metropolitan Worcester hospitals of patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of AMI and related CHD rubrics. The medical records of these patients will be individually reviewed for validation purposes according to pre-established criteria for AMI. Abstraction of the medical records of patients satisfying the study diagnostic and geographic eligibility criteria will be carried out by trained physicians with the recording of demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes related data. A review of records for additional hospitalizations and a search of death certificates will be carried out to examine the long-term survival status of discharged hospital patients from each of the proposed 2 study years, as well as those identified previously, through 2017. Death certificates will be reviewed to identify cases of out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD occurring during 2013 and 2015. In addition, we will assess the feasibility of carrying out an innovative approach for ""real time"" surveillance of acute coronary disease in this central MA population through the development of natural language processing systems that will automatically extract clinical information from electronic medical records in our most recently hospitalized patient cohort in 2015. Monitoring contemporary trends in our principal study outcomes remains timely given the ongoing publication and dissemination of treatment guidelines and recommendations by national agencies and emphasis on improving quality in processes of care. Given the ""real world"" setting of this investigation, important contemporary insights would be provided into current gaps between ideal and achieved patient care in the broader community setting, to assist in the development of novel educational approaches and incentives to provide more optimal patient care.

"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter."" Further, our enhanced product will link acute care to post-acute providers giving them advanced warning of patients who will shortly come to them for care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This decision support software identifies high-risk patients upon admission and alerts the clinicians in acute and post- acute care. This project will enhance the tool's SMART capabilities to improve its predictive accuracy and will CONNECT patients and providers with post-acute settings to coordinate the care transition.",Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support,8919460,R44NR013609,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Award', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Methodology', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transitional Care Planning', 'University Hospitals', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'operation', 'payment', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NINR,"RIGHTCARE SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2015,741098,0.030361527827645226
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants. All of this work will be pursued with our eMERGE III Network colleagues the goal of improving the quality of the health care we deliver.                ",Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy,8967443,U01HG008666,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Appendicitis', 'Archives', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Boston', 'Budgets', 'CYP3A5 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Cost Analysis', 'Costs and Benefits', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Learning', 'Legal Obligations', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Methylphenidate', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Mosaicism', 'Narcotic Addiction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'PTEN gene', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Pyloric Stenosis', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'design', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'follow-up', 'gene panel', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'pleiotropism', 'preference', 'primary pulmonary hypertension', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2015,855289,0.0018281883444191507
"Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit. The disposition plan of patients who visit an ED is to be directly discharged home, placed in observation care, or admitted to the hospital. There is mounting concern that recent increased use of observation care may also subject patients to a rapid diagnostic regiment with unknown utility. As older patients continue to  rely on the ED and hospitals for their care, the potential for treatment that is not geriatric-oriented and results in undesirable outcomes shortly after discharge is high. A negative outcome within 7-days of discharge from an acute care encounter is temporally related to the visit and has important policy implications. The goal of this research program is to identify patients at risk for a short-term negative outcome, defined as either an inpatient admission or death, within 7 days of discharge from their acute care encounter. The proposal will utilize a randomly selected sample of 5% Medicare Claims data, which amounts to 2.4 million beneficiaries, of which patients age > 65 years who visit the ED in 2012 will be analyzed. The multi-disciplinary project team includes experts in health services research, geriatrics, emergency medicine, administrative claims data research, and statistics. In Aim 1, the study will assess predictors of ED disposition (discharge or observation care) following the ED visit. The team will then conduct a stratified analysis to identify predictors of negative outcomes following discharge from observation care (Aim 2) or the ED (Aim 3). The proposal will assess the association between two sets of primary predictors, ED discharge diagnosis codes developed by the PI as well as the recently created Medicare Chronic Conditions, and outcomes. Additional variables will include patient demographics, comorbidities, facility characteristics, prior inpatient utilization, skilled nursing facility usage, and community demographics. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, assessment for similarities and collinearity between the predictors, and hierarchical random effects logistic regression models pertaining to each Aim. All project aims have sufficient power to complete the analyses. The proposed study will identify characteristics of patients at risk for negative short-term outcomes following acute care encounters and will (1) provide population-level national data to understand negative outcomes following discharge, (2) serve as a foundation for future work in developing a post-discharge intervention that will reduce these events, and (3) help ED managers, geriatricians, and health policy experts develop national guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs and more recently, observation services, employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit and could result in either admission or death within 7 days of discharge. Understanding the characteristics of patients at risk for such outcomes after discharge from the ED or observation care can help improve both ED and follow-up care. Currently, this information is not known. Our study will use national Medicare claims files to identify the patients at risk for these outcomes with the goal of helping improve care for all older adults.",Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare,8749230,R03AG047862,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'System', 'Triage', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cost', 'demographics', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'male', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2014,94500,-0.011475841058553489
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.            ",Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition,8703305,R41GM108104,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Residencies', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'case-based', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical malpractice', 'medical schools', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'undergraduate medical education', 'usability']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R41,2014,144721,0.014704380861423757
"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.            ",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8678798,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2014,145229,0.014113032624988099
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8669161,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2014,212994,0.014996369294095455
"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8821956,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2014,449993,0.0349815031223205
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases.

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.                  ",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8641674,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2014,547410,-0.0242518982505731
"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter."" Further, our enhanced product will link acute care to post-acute providers giving them advanced warning of patients who will shortly come to them for care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This decision support software identifies high-risk patients upon admission and alerts the clinicians in acute and post- acute care. This project will enhance the tool's SMART capabilities to improve its predictive accuracy and will CONNECT patients and providers with post-acute settings to coordinate the care transition.            ",Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support,8710917,R44NR013609,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Award', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transitional Care Planning', 'University Hospitals', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'operation', 'payment', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NINR,"RIGHTCARE SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2014,749637,0.030361527827645226
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care? This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher.  Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.  SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma.  SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients.  SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively.Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,8259038,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2012,154570,0.007090011556431657
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8471822,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,224100,0.014996369294095455
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Medication Intervention in Transitional Care to Optimize CKD Outcomes & Costs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary Transitional care interventions reduce hospital readmissions and slow the progression of declining health in the general population of hospitalized patients. What is not known is the impact transitional care interventions can have for the hospitalized CKD population. CKD patients are in critical need of improved transitional care that includes accurate and comprehensive medication information transfer. The main objective of this application is to pilot-test the effectiveness of a medication information transfer intervention to improve clinically-relevant outcomes in CKD. To this end, the following Specific Aims will be achieved: 1. Evaluate the impact of transitional care interventions on acute care utilization following hospital discharge among patients with CKD. 2. Evaluate the impact of transitional care strategies on management of CKD risk factors and complications. Focus groups will first be conducted to assure relevance and to refine the intervention. A qualitative research design with convenience sampling will be used to survey recently hospitalized CKD patients (n~10) and their healthcare professionals (n~10). The medication information transfer intervention will be evaluated in a pilot study using a randomized, single-blind clinical trial design. Participants and the pharmacist interventionist will have knowledge of group assignment, but the other investigators and research staff will be blinded. Study entry criteria will include hospitalized patients >21 years old (n=120) who have a diagnosis of CKD stages 3-5 (not including those treated by dialysis or kidney transplant). After obtaining IRB-approved written informed consent, patients will be randomized by computer algorithm for group assignment, stratifying according to diabetes status. The pharmacist will visit participants in the home within 5 days of hospital discharge. The 5As (Assessment, Advice, Agreement, Assistance, and Arrangements) Self-Management Model will be used to implement the medication information transfer intervention. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline and at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures for Specific Aim 1 will be acute care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations). The main outcomes for Specific Aim 2 will be measures of CKD risk factors and complications. Blood pressure will be the primary outcome for this aim because hypertension control is the most consistent recommendation for slowing CKD progression. Logistic regression analyses will be employed controlling for age, sex, CKD stage, co- morbidities, Charleson score, cognitive status, medication adherence and health literacy. Cost will be analyzed based on charges from hospitalization through the following 90 days using a difference-of- difference approach. This contribution is significant because it will define methods to overcome system barriers that result in impaired quality and continuity of care. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates established clinical strategies with systems approaches to improve patient care, thereby testing a fundamentally new approach to advance CKD management.          Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management. This medication information transfer intervention in the transitional care of hospitalized CKD patients will have wide-appeal for adoption by healthcare systems and for other chronic illnesses. The project supports the mission of NIDDK by translating lessons learned from clinical research in CKD into improved clinical outcomes that can be readily measured and anticipated in practice.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units  Project Summary  Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.  The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.  We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting the incorporation continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.  If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.  Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecaststs that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.",Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units,8256763,R01NS066008,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'time interval']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,330138,0.03336719040145536
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,8245894,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,719562,0.02146348144280112
"Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and validate a standardized, claims-based surveillance method to rank hospitals nationally based on diagnosis and procedure codes suggestive of surgical site infection (SSI) following vascular surgery. This work will be part of an ongoing collaboration between the Harvard-based CDC Prevention Epicenter, the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The first aim is to develop a set of diagnosis and procedure codes that suggest SSI following vascular surgery. We will perform a retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients who underwent one of the vascular procedures targeted by the national Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) in 2005. Approximately 100 codes that have been pre-selected as SSI indicators will be pilot tested in five CDC Prevention Epicenter hospitals using full medical record review. We will use the pilot test to refine our code list to ensure a sensitivity of at least 90% for all confirmed SSIs while attempting to maximize specificity. The second aim is to apply our refined claims-based surveillance method to the 2005-2008 Medicare national claims database. We will rank all hospitals that performed at least 200 targeted vascular procedures in Medicare patients between 2005 and 2008 (average of 50 procedures per year). Ranking will be based on the fraction of patients at each individual hospital with>1 SSI indicator according to the claims-based surveillance method. Rankings will adjust for age, gender, and Romano comorbidity score via a generalized linear mixed model that controls for clustering within institutions. Hospitals will be grouped into deciles based on their adjusted SSI rates. Finally, the third aim is to validate the ranking of hospitals in the best and worst deciles based upon nationwide review of up to 1,500 full-text records. We will perform logistic regression to assess the relationship between having a vascular surgery performed in a best versus worst deciles hospital while controlling for case mix.          Project Narrative   This partnership with CMS and CDC will enhance the national effort to identify hospitals with potentially elevated surgical site infection rates following high volume procedures. We seek to develop a standardized and less resource intensive system that will allow routine identification of hospitals with unusually high rates of these complications. This information will allow targeting of CMS and other resources to improve quality of care  by focusing on hospitals with the greatest need and potential for improvement.",Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.,8101014,F32HS018878,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2011,69107,0.017924872809571207
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.           Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,8066783,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2011,154862,0.007319557753490468
"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers. The knowledgebase helps our GCM's to prepare comprehensive care plans for elders and their care givers covering 40 care categories.

"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach No abstract available  Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,8136907,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2011,247887,0.0416382218677944
"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor. Practice guidelines have been developed to guide physicians in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, from surveillance in patients at high risk to treatment in those who develop this disease. This study proposes to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based surveillance and treatment recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma and their effect on survival, as well as consider patient, physician, and facility factors that may be associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of these guidelines.              Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor.

"Medication Intervention in Transitional Care to Optimize CKD Outcomes & Costs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary Transitional care interventions reduce hospital readmissions and slow the progression of declining health in the general population of hospitalized patients. What is not known is the impact transitional care interventions can have for the hospitalized CKD population. CKD patients are in critical need of improved transitional care that includes accurate and comprehensive medication information transfer. The main objective of this application is to pilot-test the effectiveness of a medication information transfer intervention to improve clinically-relevant outcomes in CKD. To this end, the following Specific Aims will be achieved: 1. Evaluate the impact of transitional care interventions on acute care utilization following hospital discharge among patients with CKD. 2. Evaluate the impact of transitional care strategies on management of CKD risk factors and complications. Focus groups will first be conducted to assure relevance and to refine the intervention. A qualitative research design with convenience sampling will be used to survey recently hospitalized CKD patients (n~10) and their healthcare professionals (n~10). The medication information transfer intervention will be evaluated in a pilot study using a randomized, single-blind clinical trial design. Participants and the pharmacist interventionist will have knowledge of group assignment, but the other investigators and research staff will be blinded. Study entry criteria will include hospitalized patients >21 years old (n=120) who have a diagnosis of CKD stages 3-5 (not including those treated by dialysis or kidney transplant). After obtaining IRB-approved written informed consent, patients will be randomized by computer algorithm for group assignment, stratifying according to diabetes status. The pharmacist will visit participants in the home within 5 days of hospital discharge. The 5As (Assessment, Advice, Agreement, Assistance, and Arrangements) Self-Management Model will be used to implement the medication information transfer intervention. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline and at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures for Specific Aim 1 will be acute care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations). The main outcomes for Specific Aim 2 will be measures of CKD risk factors and complications. Blood pressure will be the primary outcome for this aim because hypertension control is the most consistent recommendation for slowing CKD progression. Logistic regression analyses will be employed controlling for age, sex, CKD stage, co- morbidities, Charleson score, cognitive status, medication adherence and health literacy. Cost will be analyzed based on charges from hospitalization through the following 90 days using a difference-of- difference approach. This contribution is significant because it will define methods to overcome system barriers that result in impaired quality and continuity of care. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates established clinical strategies with systems approaches to improve patient care, thereby testing a fundamentally new approach to advance CKD management.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management. This medication information transfer intervention in the transitional care of hospitalized CKD patients will have wide-appeal for adoption by healthcare systems and for other chronic illnesses. The project supports the mission of NIDDK by translating lessons learned from clinical research in CKD into improved clinical outcomes that can be readily measured and anticipated in practice.              Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.           Project Narrative ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP).

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8055880,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,328942,0.027386290043957866
"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.           Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,8060632,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,749307,0.02146348144280112

"Tools for Optimizing Medication Safety (TOP-MEDS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a patient safety CERT focused on the theme of Tools for Optimizing Medication Safety (TOPMEDS). The long term goal is to improve patient safety by developing and refining tools for safer medication use. The short term objective is to develop, test, deploy and disseminate tools and training materials in four key areas: statistical methods for large-scale studies of comparative drug safety and effectiveness, opioid prescribing and dosing for acute pain, methods for preventing and detecting drug name confusion errors, and patient-centered, language concordant drug information. We will carry out studies with the following specific aims: 1. Develop and apply a multivariate, person-time logistic regression model for large-scale adverse drug event screening. 2. Improve the safety and effectiveness of inpatient acute pain care by developing and validating a novel, web-based simulator to train prescribers in the proper selection and dosing of opioids. 3. Refine a standard battery of tests for pre-market safety screening of drug names, and develop and test methods for preventing and detecting drug name confusion errors using electronic medical records. 4. Rigorously evaluate a low literacy strategy for promoting safe and effective prescription medication use among English and Spanish-speaking patients in an urban primary care setting. Together the projects address all five of the programmatic interest areas: comparative effectiveness, patient safety, development of tools, health care system interventions, and translation into policy or practice. UIC will host the center, with collaborators at Rush Universit Medical Center, Northwestern University, University of Chicago, the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Discerning Systems, Inc., the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, and the National Patient Safety Foundation.

"Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and validate a standardized, claims-based surveillance method to rank hospitals nationally based on diagnosis and procedure codes suggestive of surgical site infection (SSI) following vascular surgery. This work will be part of an ongoing collaboration between the Harvard-based CDC Prevention Epicenter, the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The first aim is to develop a set of diagnosis and procedure codes that suggest SSI following vascular surgery. We will perform a retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients who underwent one of the vascular procedures targeted by the national Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) in 2005. Approximately 100 codes that have been pre-selected as SSI indicators will be pilot tested in five CDC Prevention Epicenter hospitals using full medical record review. We will use the pilot test to refine our code list to ensure a sensitivity of at least 90% for all confirmed SSIs while attempting to maximize specificity. The second aim is to apply our refined claims-based surveillance method to the 2005-2008 Medicare national claims database. We will rank all hospitals that performed at least 200 targeted vascular procedures in Medicare patients between 2005 and 2008 (average of 50 procedures per year). Ranking will be based on the fraction of patients at each individual hospital with>1 SSI indicator according to the claims-based surveillance method. Rankings will adjust for age, gender, and Romano comorbidity score via a generalized linear mixed model that controls for clustering within institutions. Hospitals will be grouped into deciles based on their adjusted SSI rates. Finally, the third aim is to validate the ranking of hospitals in the best and worst deciles based upon nationwide review of up to 1,500 full-text records. We will perform logistic regression to assess the relationship between having a vascular surgery performed in a best versus worst deciles hospital while controlling for case mix.           Project Narrative  This partnership with CMS and CDC will enhance the national effort to identify hospitals with potentially elevated surgical site infection rates following high volume procedures. We seek to develop a standardized and less resource intensive system that will allow routine identification of hospitals with unusually high rates of these complications. This information will allow targeting of CMS and other resources to improve quality of care by focusing on hospitals with the greatest need and potential for improvement.",Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.,7902983,F32HS018878,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2010,66215,0.017924872809571207
"An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: The transition to the ambulatory setting following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for patients.  One important patient safety concern is failure of responsible providers to reliably follow up test results finalized after a patient is discharged. Such failure can lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and subsequent patient harm. Automated systems that ensure timely notification of these test results to responsible providers have the potential to mitigate these well documented problems and improve health care quality and safety. The goals of this project are to create an information technology-based automatic notification system to prompt responsible physicians of test results finalized after discharge and to evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of these test results. In the first phase of this study, the components of the system will be designed. These include 1) a query of all tests whose final results are pending at the time of discharge, 2) a query for the identity and email   addresses of the patient's responsible inpatient and ambulatory provider, 3) logic to exclude routinely ordered inpatient tests to avoid provider alert fatigue, 4) automatic email notification of finalized test results to responsible providers once they are available, and 5) documentation of these results in the ambulatory electronic medical record. The system is designed to facilitate timely communication and the creation of a collaborative plan of care among inpatient and outpatient providers during a patient's transition to the ambulatory setting. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to measure the impact of such a system on physician awareness. To minimize contamination, both inpatient and ambulatory providers will be randomized, and patients will only be enrolled if both responsible physicians are in the same arm of the study. Study subjects will include patients discharged from the inpatient general medicine and cardiology services at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The primary outcome will be awareness of all post-discharge test results among responsible providers. Secondary outcomes will include user satisfaction, awareness of actionable test results (as judged by providers), and whether appropriate actions are subsequently taken in response to these results (based on electronic medical record review). Physician awareness will be determined using an email survey to providers 72 hours after the first finalized test result is available. The primary outcome will be analyzed as the proportion of test results per patient of which a provider is aware using binomial logistic   regression. General estimating equations will be used to adjust for patient and physician characteristics and to cluster by physician. Over a six-month study period, 450 patients will be enrolled in order to provide adequate power to detect an improvement in awareness from 40% to 60% of results. The results of this study will inform future efforts to optimize this type of intervention both at BWH and at other institutions trying to solve this important patient safety problem.           Project Narrative: Physicians are often unaware of test results that return after a patient leaves the hospital, a problem which could lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, unnecessary ordering of additional tests, and patient harm. The goal of this project is to develop an automatic notification system to ensure that a patient's physicians receive test results that are finalized after hospital discharge. We plan to study whether this system improves physicians' awareness of these test results and then share our findings so that other health care systems can learn from our experiences.",An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge,7935467,R21HS018229,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2010,114789,0.028888298060501572
"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers.

"A Hybrid General Natural Language Processing Architecture    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records and exchanges offer new opportunities for the analysis of population health data; however, new methods in natural language processing (NLP) must first be developed to structure and codify these records, since most medical data is in the form of free text which cannot be stored and manipulated by computers. Once this is accomplished, population health data can be analyzed which will lead to better treatment guidelines, targeted drug therapy, and more cost effective care. Logical Semantics, Inc. (LSI) proposes to develop new statistical NLP methods for analyzing large scale medical domains. These methods will leverage LSI's semantic annotation technology, which has created the largest semantically annotated clinical corpus in the world. LSI's goal is to semantically index large medical record repositories accurately against propositions arranged in knowledge ontologies and make these indices available for text mining applications. The phase one research is focused on three specific aims that will lead to breakthroughs in the science of NLP: (1) Develop new statistical NLP algorithms employing a large semantically annotated medical corpus, (2) Semi-automate knowledge ontology generation, and (3) Develop and combine rule based with statistical NLP algorithms to create a superior hybrid NLP system.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine. This research will create a database of temporal orderings from events extracted from EHR patient narratives, using algorithms previously applied to news articles.",Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries,7941063,R21LM009633,"['Abbreviations', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Libraries', 'Mining', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Records', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'acronyms', 'base', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'news', 'open source', 'relational database', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R21,2010,175973,0.025845149927718778
"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8056227,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,177422,0.027386290043957866
"Automated creation of clinical progress notes with machine learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical encounters require the creation of an enormous amount of documentation. This documentation is tedious, time-consuming, and, in practice, is usually created hours after the encounter has occurred. The requirement to create this documentation places a tremendous burden on the time of clinical staff, and due to pressing workloads, can lead to incorrect recall and clinical data errors. The project intends to prove that progress note portion of this documentation process can be automated by novel application of recent advances in machine learning. A software system will be built with Support Vector Machine theory at its core. The software system can learn from existing clinical progress notes, and then apply those learned method by auto-generating the subjective/analytical portions of the note. The project will also examine learnings from individual physician notes compared to collections of multiple physician notes in order to built a superior model. The project's impact on the quality, and cost, of care should be dramatic. Reductions in documentation error rates and increases in physician productivity equate to an incredible array of quantitative benefits. Qualitatively, the project should make providing healthcare a more enjoyable experience for all involved, given the reduction of administrative time on the part of the highly skilled clinical staff.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities. Currently, creating that documentation requires a manual, and time-consuming process, which reduces the amount of time clinicians spend with patients, and increases the possibility of data errors. We propose to build a machine learning-based software system that can automatically generate the required clinical documentation, thereby saving time and reducing errors, which will improve the overall quality of patient care.              PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Medications Prescribed in Emergency Departments for Non-Traumatic Dental Conditio    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a growing attention paid by policymakers and health care researchers to the use of emergency departments (ED) for the provision of primary care services because of the continuous increase in medical and dental healthcare cost in the United States. Most patients present to ED with non-traumatic dental conditions (NTDC) and non-urgent medical conditions based on medical criteria. ED use for NTDC visits is a growing dental public health concern that requires urgent research attention. NTDC visits to ED have cost, practice, and program implications and is a potential reason for overcrowding at EDs. However, not enough is known about the population groups and treatments received by these patients at the ED for NTDC visits. NTDCs are best treated at dental offices were definitive and continuity of care can be provided. The overall goal of this project is to address the gap in knowledge related to prescription medications for NTDC visits at EDs and to explore whether racial/ethnic disparities exist in prescribing practices. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to estimate the prevalence and trend of prescription medication use for NTDC visits at EDs from 1996 to 2006. (2) to determine patient factors, provider types, hospital/ED, and geographic characteristics associated with the receipt of prescription medications for NTDC visits from 1996 to 2006. (3) to determine the rates of use of prescription medication for NTDC visits based on physician diagnosis codes, and to specifically evaluate the influence of patients' race/ethnicity on the likelihood of receiving similar prescription for the same physician diagnosis codes. The database for the proposed study, the 1996-2006 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), is the longest continuously running nationally representative survey of ED utilization maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics. Data from NHAMCS provides an extremely rich set of measures on key patient demographics, geographic and hospital/ED characteristics, and provider Information. Access to the database provides a unique opportunity to examine medication prescription practices from 1996 to 2006 to patients presenting to ED for NTDC visits and whether disparities exists. The study population will include children and adults in the database with assigned International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code by ED healthcare providers that meet the criteria for NTDC visits. Logistic regression models will be fit to determine outcome variables associated with other covariates. The findings from the proposed study would serve as a starting point for the development of data-driven program and policy interventions that can be used to improve access to dental care and reduce oral health care disparities, if they exist. Findings from the study will be used to inform the development of prescription medication treatment guidelines for managing patients presenting to ED for NTDC visits in situation where it is unavoidable. In addition, the project provides the opportunity to build research capacity within the dental school and to train dental and graduate students in research methods for potential careers in research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying the different population groups and the medications prescribed for NTDC visits at EDs is important for dental public health programming. Dental public health professionals and stakeholders are able to use this information to development appropriate intervention strategies including the formulation of an appropriate national medication guideline for NTDC visits at EDs, where it is unavoidable.             Public Health Relevance: Identifying the different population groups and the medications prescribed for NTDC visits at EDs is important for dental public health programming.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.           Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7784533,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,341606,0.027386290043957866

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.           Project Narrative ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP).

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7937047,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2010,493567,0.01824338405390657
"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7941068,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2010,496075,0.0416382218677944
"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7867849,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,759696,0.02146348144280112
"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information.

"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7908950,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,17240,0.031783827385143695
"Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have periodically published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pneumonia. In 2005, the ATS/IDSA published guidelines which define a new subset of pneumonia entitled Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP). HCAP pertains to patients that have frequently interacted with the Health Care system prior to pneumonia, which is thought to increase risk for infections caused by multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The guidelines recommend aggressive diagnosis and antibiotic treatment regimens for HCAP. Research specific to HCAP is limited and the guideline recommendations have been questioned. Proposal Aims include: 1) to compare clinical outcome of patients with HCAP that receive standard community acquired pneumonia (CAP) therapy to those that receive alternative therapy such as guideline similar therapy (GTS)]; 2) identify risk factors for MDR bacteria including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to non-MDR bacteria and develop models that accurately identify patients infected with MDR. This will be a multi- center retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs Medical Center inpatients with HCAP. Propensity score matching will be used to adjust for potential confounding and selection bias associated with non-random treatment allocation. Generalized estimating equations will be used to characterize associations between 30-day survival and treatments: standard CAP; anti-MRSA and anti-Pseudomonas or GST, anti-MRSA, anti-Pseudomonas, or other therapies. In Aim 2 MDR status will be determined for all subjects. Logistic regression will be used to develop descriptive models of MDR risk based on non-HCAP specific risk criteria reported in the guidelines as well as HCAP specific data from the cohort. The process will be repeated for specific MDR pathogens: MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The best model of MDR status will be refitted with MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa data and compared to pathogen- specific derived models. The proposed study will determine whether adherence to HCAP guideline recommended treatments improve survival. Further developing specific prediction rules for MDR pathogens will refine future empirical HCAP antibiotic selection. Finally, determining which patients may benefit most from empirical MDR directed antibiotic therapy may help to limit antibiotic resistance. R&R: Other Project Materials 7. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Patients with exposure to the Health Care system resources are at increased risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study is to determine how frequently antibiotic resistant bacteria cause Health Care Associated pneumonia, what type of Health Care exposures are related to developing a pneumonia due to resistant bacteria, and what antibiotic treatment combinations work the best for Health Care Associated pneumonia. This study will improve public health by helping health care providers choose the right antibiotics when treating Health Care Associated pneumonia and not using more antibiotics than necessary.                n/a","Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia",7640772,R03AI074894,"['Adherence', 'Alternative Therapies', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Macrolides', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Refit', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Societies', 'Sputum', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'drug resistant bacteria', 'health care model', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'standard care']",NIAID,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,62312,0.01934554971638535
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although 78% of smokers report that a health professional has previously advised them to quit smoking, most smokers are not advised to stop smoking or offered assistance with smoking cessation during a given ED visit. There are multiple barriers to routine implementation of smoking cessation guidelines by emergency clinicians, however, and rigorously performed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that routine screening and counseling of ED patients results in increased quit rates. To determine the feasibility of implementing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Smoking Cessation Guideline in the ED, we will conduct a clinical trial in 974 ambulatory adult smokers who present to 2 emergency departments, using a pre-post design. During the 3-month baseline period, clinicians will perform their usual duties but will not receive training in use of the AHRQ Guideline. Based on the Chronic Care Model, the 3-month intervention period will include: 1) a tutorial on brief cessation counseling for ED nurses and physicians, 2) use of an ED algorithm that includes recommended tobacco counseling items, 3) fax referral of motivated smokers to the Iowa Quitline for proactive telephone counseling plus free nicotine replacement therapy, and 4) group and individual feedback to ED staff. We will conduct exit interviews of ED patients to assess performance of guideline-recommended actions by ED staff and 3- and 6-month telephone follow-up to determine 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (with biochemical confirmation of self-reported quitters at 6 months). Our main analyses will examine the contrast between the intervention and control periods in the performance of guideline- recommended actions and in 6-month quit rates, using hierarchical logistic regression to adjust for baseline differences in potentially confounding patient variables. In secondary analyses, we will assess the change in attitudes of ED nurses and physicians toward smoking cessation counseling. This feasibility study will determine the receptivity of patients and ED staff to the guideline-based intervention and will provide estimates of effect size in planning a full scale multi-site clinical trial of the study intervention in community hospital EDs.          n/a",The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department,7651300,R21DA021607,"['Abstinence', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Biochemical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Iowa', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Telefacsimile', 'Telephone', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse prevention', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'community based care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'multi-site trial', 'nicotine replacement', 'quitline', 'routine care', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2009,112500,-0.021769673527793954
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,7639826,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2009,153790,0.007319557753490468
"An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: The transition to the ambulatory setting following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for patients.  One important patient safety concern is failure of responsible providers to reliably follow up test results finalized after a patient is discharged. Such failure can lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and subsequent patient harm. Automated systems that ensure timely notification of these test results to responsible providers have the potential to mitigate these well documented problems and improve health care quality and safety. The goals of this project are to create an information technology-based automatic notification system to prompt responsible physicians of test results finalized after discharge and to evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of these test results. In the first phase of this study, the components of the system will be designed. These include 1) a query of all tests whose final results are pending at the time of discharge, 2) a query for the identity and email   addresses of the patient's responsible inpatient and ambulatory provider, 3) logic to exclude routinely ordered inpatient tests to avoid provider alert fatigue, 4) automatic email notification of finalized test results to responsible providers once they are available, and 5) documentation of these results in the ambulatory electronic medical record. The system is designed to facilitate timely communication and the creation of a collaborative plan of care among inpatient and outpatient providers during a patient's transition to the ambulatory setting. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to measure the impact of such a system on physician awareness. To minimize contamination, both inpatient and ambulatory providers will be randomized, and patients will only be enrolled if both responsible physicians are in the same arm of the study. Study subjects will include patients discharged from the inpatient general medicine and cardiology services at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The primary outcome will be awareness of all post-discharge test results among responsible providers. Secondary outcomes will include user satisfaction, awareness of actionable test results (as judged by providers), and whether appropriate actions are subsequently taken in response to these results (based on electronic medical record review). Physician awareness will be determined using an email survey to providers 72 hours after the first finalized test result is available. The primary outcome will be analyzed as the proportion of test results per patient of which a provider is aware using binomial logistic   regression. General estimating equations will be used to adjust for patient and physician characteristics and to cluster by physician. Over a six-month study period, 450 patients will be enrolled in order to provide adequate power to detect an improvement in awareness from 40% to 60% of results. The results of this study will inform future efforts to optimize this type of intervention both at BWH and at other institutions trying to solve this important patient safety problem.           Project Narrative: Physicians are often unaware of test results that return after a patient leaves the hospital, a problem which could lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, unnecessary ordering of additional tests, and patient harm. The goal of this project is to develop an automatic notification system to ensure that a patient's physicians receive test results that are finalized after hospital discharge. We plan to study whether this system improves physicians' awareness of these test results and then share our findings so that other health care systems can learn from our experiences.",An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge,7773972,R21HS018229,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2009,169859,0.028888298060501572
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine. This research will create a database of temporal orderings from events extracted from EHR patient narratives, using algorithms previously applied to news articles.",Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries,7789943,R21LM009633,"['Abbreviations', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Libraries', 'Mining', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Records', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'acronyms', 'base', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'news', 'open source', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,177750,0.025845149927718778
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7918614,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2009,185745,0.018643924905783753
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7691699,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,311821,0.031783827385143695
"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.           Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts.

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,0.027386290043957866

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7761795,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2009,447671,0.0416382218677944
"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7825111,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2009,494693,0.01824338405390657
"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7620456,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,791582,0.02146348144280112
"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information. A novel system for partitioning data along the information axes of space, time, existence, and causality is proposed to improve navigation and assimilation of data within the medical record.",Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology,7567140,R01LM009961,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Assimilations', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'open source', 'physical state', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,953185,0.03955903926438446
"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

"Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have periodically published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pneumonia. In 2005, the ATS/IDSA published guidelines which define a new subset of pneumonia entitled Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP). HCAP pertains to patients that have frequently interacted with the Health Care system prior to pneumonia, which is thought to increase risk for infections caused by multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The guidelines recommend aggressive diagnosis and antibiotic treatment regimens for HCAP. Research specific to HCAP is limited and the guideline recommendations have been questioned. Proposal Aims include: 1) to compare clinical outcome of patients with HCAP that receive standard community acquired pneumonia (CAP) therapy to those that receive alternative therapy such as guideline similar therapy (GTS)]; 2) identify risk factors for MDR bacteria including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to non-MDR bacteria and develop models that accurately identify patients infected with MDR. This will be a multi- center retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs Medical Center inpatients with HCAP. Propensity score matching will be used to adjust for potential confounding and selection bias associated with non-random treatment allocation. Generalized estimating equations will be used to characterize associations between 30-day survival and treatments: standard CAP; anti-MRSA and anti-Pseudomonas or GST, anti-MRSA, anti-Pseudomonas, or other therapies. In Aim 2 MDR status will be determined for all subjects. Logistic regression will be used to develop descriptive models of MDR risk based on non-HCAP specific risk criteria reported in the guidelines as well as HCAP specific data from the cohort. The process will be repeated for specific MDR pathogens: MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The best model of MDR status will be refitted with MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa data and compared to pathogen- specific derived models. The proposed study will determine whether adherence to HCAP guideline recommended treatments improve survival. Further developing specific prediction rules for MDR pathogens will refine future empirical HCAP antibiotic selection. Finally, determining which patients may benefit most from empirical MDR directed antibiotic therapy may help to limit antibiotic resistance. R&R: Other Project Materials 7. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Patients with exposure to the Health Care system resources are at increased risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study is to determine how frequently antibiotic resistant bacteria cause Health Care Associated pneumonia, what type of Health Care exposures are related to developing a pneumonia due to resistant bacteria, and what antibiotic treatment combinations work the best for Health Care Associated pneumonia. This study will improve public health by helping health care providers choose the right antibiotics when treating Health Care Associated pneumonia and not using more antibiotics than necessary.                n/a","Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia",7532576,R03AI074894,"['Adherence', 'Alternative Therapies', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Macrolides', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Other Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recommendation', 'Refit', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Score', 'Selection Bias', 'Societies', 'Sputum', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'day', 'drug resistant bacteria', 'health care model', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling']",NIAID,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,61996,0.01934554971638535
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7579478,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Count', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Pliability', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice based research', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Score', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'concept', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,299619,0.031783827385143695
"The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although 78% of smokers report that a health professional has previously advised them to quit smoking, most smokers are not advised to stop smoking or offered assistance with smoking cessation during a given ED visit. There are multiple barriers to routine implementation of smoking cessation guidelines by emergency clinicians, however, and rigorously performed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that routine screening and counseling of ED patients results in increased quit rates. To determine the feasibility of implementing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Smoking Cessation Guideline in the ED, we will conduct a clinical trial in 974 ambulatory adult smokers who present to 2 emergency departments, using a pre-post design. During the 3-month baseline period, clinicians will perform their usual duties but will not receive training in use of the AHRQ Guideline. Based on the Chronic Care Model, the 3-month intervention period will include: 1) a tutorial on brief cessation counseling for ED nurses and physicians, 2) use of an ED algorithm that includes recommended tobacco counseling items, 3) fax referral of motivated smokers to the Iowa Quitline for proactive telephone counseling plus free nicotine replacement therapy, and 4) group and individual feedback to ED staff. We will conduct exit interviews of ED patients to assess performance of guideline-recommended actions by ED staff and 3- and 6-month telephone follow-up to determine 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (with biochemical confirmation of self-reported quitters at 6 months). Our main analyses will examine the contrast between the intervention and control periods in the performance of guideline- recommended actions and in 6-month quit rates, using hierarchical logistic regression to adjust for baseline differences in potentially confounding patient variables. In secondary analyses, we will assess the change in attitudes of ED nurses and physicians toward smoking cessation counseling. This feasibility study will determine the receptivity of patients and ED staff to the guideline-based intervention and will provide estimates of effect size in planning a full scale multi-site clinical trial of the study intervention in community hospital EDs.          n/a",The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department,7380300,R21DA021607,"['Abstinence', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Biochemical', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Iowa', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Telefacsimile', 'Telephone', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse prevention', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'community based care', 'day', 'design', 'desire', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'nicotine replacement', 'quitline', 'size', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2008,300000,-0.021769673527793954
"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7502749,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2008,352226,-0.01261909886701485
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7675157,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2008,354823,0.018643924905783753

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7461372,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'computerized', 'day', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,823164,0.02146348144280112
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical inforrnatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6944955,F38LM008478,"['Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inpatients', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Statistical Study', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'skills', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2007,38768,0.013302044079491022

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7282343,K22LM008805,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Applications Grants', 'Caring', 'Causations', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Negligence', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States', 'base', 'computerized', 'concept', 'experience', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2007,135000,0.05430810268275156
"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,0.009419066579451237
"Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Diagnosing a patient's condition and predicting the patient's outcomes are critical activities in clinical care. The better these activities can be performed, the better the patient's healthcare results are likely to be. Similarly, efficient use of healthcare resources depends upon being able to determine accurately when and where a resource is likely to be useful, which also involves making predictions. Even modest improvements in predictive accuracy can at times have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Thus, for both individual patients and for society at large, making accurate healthcare predictions is an important task.      There is a clear trend toward having more and more patient data that is available electronically in healthcare information systems and in databases of clinical research studies. Thus, there is an opportunity to construct evidence-based predictive models from these data sources. Indeed, numerous clinical prediction models have already been constructed. Typically, a single prediction model has been induced from the data, and then applied -- as relevant -- to each future patient. Such a population-wide model is constructed to try to optimize its average predictive performance on all future patient cases to which it is applied. Model induction does not take advantage of information about the patient case at hand, which could potentially enhance the form and content of the model that is constructed.      The current project will investigate methods that construct patient-specific models that are sensitive to information about the patient at hand. These new methods will be evaluated for their performance in predicting patient outcomes in the diverse domains of sepsis, heart failure and substance use disorders. A variety of current population-wide model-construction methods, including logistic regression and neural networks, will serve as controls.      If patient-specific models can improve upon the predictive performance of population-wide models, as seems plausible, the added performance is likely to provide substantial benefit as a component of future computer-based decision-support systems for clinical care. n/a",Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data,7185137,R01LM008374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Societies', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,278631,0.024734031965055997

In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7217497,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,361696,0.018643924905783753
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7380099,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2007,383550,-0.01261909886701485
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7272822,R01EB002247,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Body of uterus', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Oncologist', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Slice', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teleconsultations', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'health care quality', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'size', 'telehealth']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,394864,0.010341015964351868
"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serveCDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections PreventiveService, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center.

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7124706,K22LM008805,"['automated medical record system', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'health care quality', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'information retrieval', 'medical records', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'patient safety /medical error']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2006,135000,0.05430810268275156
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,7110256,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,478733,0.015728920820571247

More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6912634,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,478937,0.015728920820571247
"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution.  n/a",Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing,7098649,R01PH000022,"['abstracting', 'artificial intelligence', 'biohazard detection', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'environmental health', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'model design /development', 'public health', 'rapid diagnosis', 'vocabulary development for information system']",PHPPO,MAYO CLINIC,R01,2005,514616,0.003760870449524524
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6917854,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,593264,0.039877888522448376
"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6930547,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disasters', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'geographic site', 'human data', 'human population study', 'public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2005,594222,0.016200716775762545
"Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-term objectives of this project are to improve the safety and availability of the US blood supply. The principal aim of this SBIR Competing Continuation Phase II Proposal for a Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making is to complete the development of its Quality Donor System(tm) (QDS) and to secure ongoing 510(k) clearances for it from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologies Evaluation and Research (CBER) for implementation and evaluation of the total system in blood centers and hospital blood banks.      The research is based on continuing development of the Quality Donor System and deploying it in regional blood centers and hospital blood banks. System use by donors and staff and user satisfaction will be measured and analyzed to assess success. Blood safety is enhanced by eliminating FDA-reportable errors and by increasing blood donor honesty in disclosing risky behaviors. Blood availability is enhanced by increasing donor satisfaction, resulting in higher return rates for new blood donors and increasing employer sponsorship of blood drives. n/a",Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making,6990079,R44HL072635,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blood bank /supply contamination', 'blood donor', 'case history', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'decision making', 'human subject', 'interview', 'nonEnglish language', 'patient safety /medical error', 'phlebotomy']",NHLBI,"TALISMAN, LTD",R44,2005,910764,0.005241225770138513
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical informatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6836781,F38LM008478,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'human data', 'library', 'mathematical model', 'public health', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2004,94545,0.013163113350621999

"CHILD ABUSE REPORTING EXPERIENCE STUDY (CARES)   The number of children who are maltreated each year in the US                      continues to increase. Despite this alarming statistic, primary care                 practitioners (PCPs)are not frequent reporters of suspected child abuse              (SCAN)to government child protection agencies (CPS). The reasons for this are        not yet understood. This proposed research will provide the first                    comprehensive description and analysis of the management of SCAN in primary          care practices.                                                                                                                                                           This study is a prospective descriptive study of practitioner management of          16,000 childhood injuries. Data will be collected in the Pediatric Research in       Office Setting (PROS)Network using a protocol that is derived from one that          was piloted in a regional practice-based research network (PBRN). Four hundred       PROS PCP will each gather information about 40 consecutive injury visits. They       will report medical diagnosis, demographic information, and their level of           suspicion for child physical abuse. Follow-up telephone calls to the PCP will        elicit further information about the management of these injuries. This data         will be used to construct vignettes. The response of a panel of child abuse          experts to these vignettes will be used to evaluate the PCP management of            suspected abuse and the rate of false positive and false negative reports to         CPS.                                                                                                                                                                      The data collected will be used to address the following specific aims               concerning the care of SCAN by PCPs: (1) Identify PCP related factors that           affect identification of maltreatment; (2) Identify PCP related factors that         affect management of any suspicious injuries; and, (3) Assess the validity of        PCP management of childhood injuries.

"Ethnic Variation in Hospice Use Among Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Within the last three decades, hospice care has emerged as an important form of end-of-life care in the United States. Hospice care provides an alternative to traditional, curative medicine by offering dying patients palliation from physical, emotional and spiritual suffering. In the last decade, hospice utilization in the United States has increased rapidly. In addition, the type of patient entering hospice care has changed. Until recently, the majority of patients using hospice care were older, middle class, and non-Hispanic Whites with a cancer diagnosis. Now, as the older adult population becomes more ethnically diverse and advances continue to be made in life-prolonging technologies, the profile of the typical hospice patient is also changing.      There is a growing concern in the hospice community that members of racial and ethnic minority groups are underutilizing hospice care in comparison to Non-Hispanic Whites. It is important to: 1) determine if disparities in hospice utilization exist among different racial and ethnic groups; and 2) explain why these disparities exist. The purpose of this study is to examine variation in the use of hospice care by patient race and ethnicity.      The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) investigate differences in the use of hospice care by patient race and ethnicity; 2) examine racial and ethnic differences in hospice use by type of cancer diagnosis; 3) assess racial and ethnic differences in the use of hospice care by geographic location; and   4) examine variation in the use of hospice care over time by patient race and ethnicity.      Data from the linked SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database will be used to study hospice care utilization in subjects diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal or prostate cancer from 1986 to 1996 at age 65 and over who died from 1991 to 1999. The SEER population covers approximately 14% of the United States. Logistic regression analyses and chi-square analyses will be used to achieve the study goals. The findings will contribute to the existing knowledge of hospice care utilization among four racial and ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians and Pacific Islanders) in the United States.         n/a",Ethnic Variation in Hospice Use Among Cancer Patients,6594260,R03HS013547,"['African American', ' Asians', ' Hispanic Americans', ' Pacific Islander', ' breast neoplasms', ' caucasian American', ' clinical research', ' colorectal neoplasms', ' epidemiology', ' geographic difference', ' health care service utilization', ' health disparity', ' health services research tag', ' hospices', ' hospital length of stay', ' human subject', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' prostate neoplasms', ' racial /ethnic difference']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R03,2003,32400,-0.01825845385000777

"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge.

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6558664,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', ' clinical research', ' data collection', ' health science research', ' human data', ' informatics', ' library', ' medical records', ' molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,464049,0.015728920820571247

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6678913,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information display', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,572597,0.039877888522448376
"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6673408,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disasters', ' disease outbreaks', ' early diagnosis', ' geographic site', ' human data', ' human population study', ' public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2003,606068,0.016200716775762545
"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness.

"Nurse Staffing and Adverse Patient Outcomes A public concern pertaining to patient safety is that hospitals may currently be providing inadequate nurse staffing, consequently jeopardizing the quality of patient care. Recently, several studies have examined the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes. Whereas these studies have produced empirical findings supporting this relationship, this study examines the cost-benefits of increasing nurse staffing as well as the nurse staffing-patient outcomes relationship. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to examine hospital characteristics that affect nurse staffing; (2) to examine the effects of nurse staffing on the occurrence of adverse events; (3) to assess the consequences of adverse events on morbidity, mortality and medical costs and decreased medical care costs due to decreases in adverse events as the benefits of increasing nurse staffing. A cross-sectional study design will be conducted using two existing databases of California acute care hospitals. Nurse staffing will be measured by six indicators, including nursing intensity-adjusted nursing hours per patient worked by registered nurses, all nursing personnel, and agency or contract personnel, skill mix, overtime index, and labor productivity. Adverse events include adverse drug events, patient falls, pressure ulcers, and nosocomial infections. These adverse events will be detected by using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnosis codes. Morbidity attributed to adverse events will be indirectly measured by prolonged length of stay. Analyses will employ multiple regression, logistic regression, or mixed models, depending on the dependent variables. Patient characteristics will be controlled for to isolate the effects of nurse staffing on patient outcomes. The cost benefit analysis from the hospital perspective will examine whether the benefits of increasing nurse staffing are greater than its costs. This study will provide guidelines for determining appropriate nurse staffing levels in hospitals with differing characteristics, such as patient populations and types of care provided.  n/a",Nurse Staffing and Adverse Patient Outcomes,6352397,R03HS011397,"['accidental falls', ' clinical research', ' cost effectiveness', ' decubitus ulcer', ' health care cost /financing', ' health care facility information system', ' health services research tag', ' hospital analysis', ' hospital length of stay', ' hospital patient care', ' human data', ' human morbidity', ' human mortality', ' iatrogenic disease', ' nurse patient relations', ' nursing administration', ' nursing care quality', ' nursing personnel', ' outcomes research', ' patient safety /medical error', ' statistics /biometry']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2001,31116,0.030816510444069318
"COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS DESCRIPTION:  The project goal is to continue development of a practical, easily usable software system (SCSS) to assist physicians in providing smoking cessation counseling to their patients who smoke.  This system, begun under a SBIR Phase-I program, provides on-line, real-time assessment of a patient's smoking history, nicotine dependence, and relevant variables, produces a feedback report to the patient and provides treatment guidelines for physicians.  An efficacy study will be used to examine the relative utility of this system compared to a low-cost control in an A-B-A design.  It is anticipated that utilization of the SCSS system will 1) increase rates of physician intervention in smoking cessation, and 2) increase quit attempts and cessation among patients.  Testing will occur in an inner-city primary care clinic serving low income and ethnic minority individuals.  Testing at secondary sites across the US will enhance representation of diverse ethnic groups.  Focus groups will be conducted to obtain feedback from physicians and representatives of healthcare management organizations.  Results will be used to finalize the software system and prepare collateral materials necessary for commercial production.

"DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM Occupational health receives too little attention in primary care settings; in addition, public health surveillance acquires and utilizes too little of the information available in clinical settings.  Obtaining an appropriate occupational history requires both time and expert knowledge about occupational medicine, both of which are inadequate in most primary care settings.  The DOKS (Distributed Occupational Knowledge System addresses these problems by developing a computer assisted system, which may be directly incorporated in routine primary health care delivery. It obtains a computer assisted occupational history and makes case specific recommendations for preventive interventions.  It will also systematically collect clinical information for public health analysis.  The system will be implemented in three different health ambulatory care settings- county hospital based, health maintenance organization, and clinic group.  Initially, interviews will be in person, then by phone, and later by computer.  Recommendations are provided to patients and clinical care providers.  Evaluation includes historical and concurrent controls and is based on exit and 3 month interviews and record review.

The response of a panel of child abuse          experts to these vignettes will be used to evaluate the PCP management of            suspected abuse and the rate of false positive and false negative reports to         CPS.                                                                                                                                                                      The data collected will be used to address the following specific aims               concerning the care of SCAN by PCPs: (1) Identify PCP related factors that           affect identification of maltreatment; (2) Identify PCP related factors that         affect management of any suspicious injuries; and, (3) Assess the validity of        PCP management of childhood injuries.                                                                                                                                     Multivariate logistic regression modeling will be used to develop a robust           model of PCP decision-making concerning SCAN. This study will provide the most       thorough description ever of SCAN in primary care, thus providing important          data needed for both research and policy in the area of child abuse                  identification and management.                                                                              n/a",CHILD ABUSE REPORTING EXPERIENCE STUDY (CARES),6430171,R01HS010746,"['child abuse', ' clinical research', ' decision making', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient care management', ' pediatrics', ' primary care physician']",AHRQ,CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (CHICAGO),R01,2001,582582,-0.0069947964660772395
"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This research will provide a means to optimize structured recording of patient test results in a computer-searchable format improving the process of procedural reporting, and facilitating implementation of an electronic medical record.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING,6141030,R43HL062806,"['artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' echocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' human data', ' informatics']",NHLBI,"CYBERPULSE, LLC",R43,2000,107000,0.0005704411010542188
"DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM Occupational health receives too little attention in primary care settings; in addition, public health surveillance acquires and utilizes too little of the information available in clinical settings.  Obtaining an appropriate occupational history requires both time and expert knowledge about occupational medicine, both of which are inadequate in most primary care settings.  The DOKS (Distributed Occupational Knowledge System addresses these problems by developing a computer assisted system, which may be directly incorporated in routine primary health care delivery. It obtains a computer assisted occupational history and makes case specific recommendations for preventive interventions.  It will also systematically collect clinical information for public health analysis.  The system will be implemented in three different health ambulatory care settings- county hospital based, health maintenance organization, and clinic group.  Initially, interviews will be in person, then by phone, and later by computer.  Recommendations are provided to patients and clinical care providers.  Evaluation includes historical and concurrent controls and is based on exit and 3 month interviews and record review.  The process also yields valuable surveillance data including population segments often missed by other methods and describing functional impact of work rather than just occupationally caused disease.  n/a",DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM,6174427,R01CA086470,"['artificial intelligence', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' patient care management']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2000,187587,0.02901634577737839
"COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS DESCRIPTION:  The project goal is to continue development of a practical, easily usable software system (SCSS) to assist physicians in providing smoking cessation counseling to their patients who smoke.  This system, begun under a SBIR Phase-I program, provides on-line, real-time assessment of a patient's smoking history, nicotine dependence, and relevant variables, produces a feedback report to the patient and provides treatment guidelines for physicians.  An efficacy study will be used to examine the relative utility of this system compared to a low-cost control in an A-B-A design.  It is anticipated that utilization of the SCSS system will 1) increase rates of physician intervention in smoking cessation, and 2) increase quit attempts and cessation among patients.  Testing will occur in an inner-city primary care clinic serving low income and ethnic minority individuals.  Testing at secondary sites across the US will enhance representation of diverse ethnic groups.  Focus groups will be conducted to obtain feedback from physicians and representatives of healthcare management organizations.  Results will be used to finalize the software system and prepare collateral materials necessary for commercial production. Traditionally underserved populations are targeted as they present a challenge for treatment in that these have limited resources and access to preventive care.  n/a",COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS,6072500,R44CA074624,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' interactive multimedia', ' smoking cessation', ' tobacco abuse', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,"BOCK TO THE FUTURE, INC",R44,2000,196068,0.018233054829825138
"DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER Many primary care physicians are unable to proficiently triage skin lesions suspicious for cancer, compromising patients' health. Decision support software could help in the early detection of skin cancer, decreasing morbidity and mortality related to skin cancer misdiagnoses. It also could reduce unnecessary referrals to specialists, lowering health care costs. In Phase I, we demonstrated that decision support software can significantly improve physicians' ability to arrive at appropriate triage decisions for a variety skin lesions, including cancerous lesions. In Phase II, we propose to l) expand the decision support software to triage for pigmented lesions and a wider range of nonpigmented skin lesions; 2) incorporate case-based reasoning methods into the software to enable users to conduct a confidence check on their final triage decision and to help them make the correct decision at each branch point in the decision tree; 3) develop a teaching application based on the decision tree; 4) enable the software to produce for patients individualized information on skin cancer prevention and treatment; 5) interface the decision support software with the computerized patient medical record; and 6) test the effectiveness, utility, and feasibility of the decision support software with a sample of primary care physicians and patients. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This research is designed to produce comprehensive decision support software that will be a commercially viable product. Two large potential markets for this product are medical schools, which may use the software as a teaching aid, and medical settings, which may use the software as a clinical tool for practicing primary care physicians.  n/a",DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER,6172710,R44CA075906,"['cancer information system', ' cancer prevention', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' medical records', ' melanoma', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy', ' pigments', ' skin neoplasms']",NCI,WEST PORTAL SOFTWARE CORPORATION,R44,2000,329958,-0.0012882229898402713
"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge. During weaning trials, f/Vt and ePCWP will be also measured at 3-day intervals. Data will be analyzed using logistic regression, analysis of covariance, proportional hazards regression, and linear mixed effect models. To accomplish our Secondary Aims, we will construct weaning patterns for each subject, identify the proportion of weaning patterns which can be reliably differentiated as consistent weaning progress, and use stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify variables which predict weaning consistent progress, irrespective of group.  n/a",IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS,6091418,R01NR005204,"['artificial respiration', ' clinical research', ' critical care nursing', ' extended care', ' human subject', ' intensive care', ' managed care', ' nurse practitioners', ' outcomes research', ' respirators']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2000,433046,0.024536052526515195
