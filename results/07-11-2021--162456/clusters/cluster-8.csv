"Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test ABSTRACT The HPV vaccine is highly effective in clinical trials, with an absolute risk of persistent (6+ months) infection with vaccine-type high-risk HPV of only 1.4% among vaccinated women. As prevalence of HPV infection decreases, the risk of false positive cervical cancer screening results increases. However, current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Data cannot be extrapolated from other countries with different HPV vaccination coverage, as cross-protection against non- vaccine type HPV infection varies by population vaccination rates, and are likely to affect screening test performance. Major challenges in development of new U.S. guidelines are anticipated for the following reasons: 1) large U.S. population-based data on HPV infection rates and cervical cancer screening test statistics are currently not available, and likely vary by regional vaccination rates; 2) most studies evaluating cervical cancer screening results in vaccinated women do not differentiate between those who have received only 1 dose of the vaccine and those who have completed the 2-3 dose series; 3) few studies have evaluated differences in outcomes by age at HPV vaccine initiation or interval between doses. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to determine an optimal cervical cancer screening strategy for women vaccinated against HPV. The objectives of this pilot research are to 1) determine if the prevalence of cervical dysplasia has decreased with HPV vaccination and resultantly changed the PPV of cervical cancer screening tests, and 2) determine if cervical cancer screening test performance varies by age at HPV vaccine initiation, number of doses, or interval between HPV vaccine doses. Aim1: Determine if the decrease in prevalence of cervical dysplasia among vaccinated women has resulted in a decrease in the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests. A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare cervical cancer screening and diagnostic test results among HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Positive predictive values for positive HPV tests and abnormal cytology results to predict high-grade dysplasia will be compared by HPV vaccination status. Aim2: Determine if cervical cancer screening test accuracy varies by age at vaccine initiation, number of doses received, and/or interval between doses. The positive predictive value of positive HPV tests and abnormal Pap test results among vaccinated women will be compared by the number of vaccine doses received (1 vs. 2+), age at vaccine initiation, and interval between doses using logistic regression. Project Narrative Current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between women who have and have not been vaccinated to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. United States data to inform changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines for vaccinated women are urgently needed to ensure that harms of screening these women at low risk for cancer do not outweigh the benefits. The results of this research will provide an estimate of the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests (Pap tests, HPV tests) post-vaccination, and define a population of women who are adequately vaccinated (based on age at vaccine initiation, number of vaccine doses, and interval between doses) to benefit from what will likely be decreased cervical cancer screening without significant increase in cancer risk.",Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test,9936304,R03HS026982,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2020,45234,0.010091001531574974
"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9998913,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2020,158153,0.1501205117697242
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9986702,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2020,171720,0.1424142379658928
"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10051055,R61AG068951,"['Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Preventive screening', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer type', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2020,279223,0.050914118166908266
"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10050712,R61AG068947,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccination', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'cancer health disparity', 'clinical care', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'design', 'discounting', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness testing', 'end of life', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health care settings', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention cost', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'racial and ethnic', 'scale up', 'screening', 'screening disparities', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,329875,0.05541674829804301
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9869938,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,356700,0.13169421122183964
"Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals ABSTRACT Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people face a disproportionate burden of adverse health outcomes. Although there is a growing body of literature on the unique health issues among TGNC populations, they remain severely underserved as existing data on TGNC health are scarce. Under-reporting is common due to issues related to social and economic marginalization, stigma, and discrimination, leading to challenges in obtaining population-based estimates since TGNC individuals are often unwilling to self-identify and reluctant to participate in traditional surveys. Further, past TGNC research has primarily focused on mental health, substance use and abuse, and sexual transmitted infections and diseases. There is limited data available on age-related chronic conditions such as cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, cancer is one of the top research priorities among the TGNC population. With a rapidly growing aging TGNC population, there is an urgent need to characterize the cancer burden among these individuals and understand how cancer impact them differentially compared to non-TGNC individuals. On the other hand, rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has made longitudinal clinical data available for research. EHRs contain not only important structured data, such as demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and medications, but also unstructured clinical narratives such as physician’s notes. More than 80 percent of the clinical information is documented in clinical narratives, which contain more detailed patient information including gender identity and cancer risk factors. Motivated by these observations and built upon our previous studies on 1) the adequacy of TGNC gender identity terms, 2) clinical natural language processing methods for information extraction, and 3) EHR-based cohort studies, we propose to conduct a population-based cohort analysis to examine the cancer burden and risk factors among TGNC people using a unique data source from a large network of EHRs—OneFlorida, one of the 13 PCORI-funded clinical data research networks (CDRNs) contributing to the PCORnet. Using both structured and unstructured OneFlorida data, we will first develop computable phenotypes to identify TGNC individuals and subsequently evaluate their cancer risk. Our research is significant because: 1) no population-based cohort studies on cancer risk have been conducted among the TGNC population. Our results will support the development of tailored, evidence- based cancer screening programs for TGNC people; 2) our research will create a cohort of TGNC people that can be not only tracked longitudinally in EHR but also recruited for future clinical studies; and 3) working with a PCORnet CDRN makes our analysis framework generalizable to the overall PCORNet. Overall, the proposed research will advance our knowledge in cancer among the aging TGNC population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will fill an important gap in our knowledge of cancer burden and risk factors in transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people, a sexual and gender minority (SGM) group. A computable phenotype that can accurately identify TGNC cohorts in large networks of electronic health records (EHRs) enables us to monitor TGNC health longitudinally, which is significant for aging-related diseases such as cancer. Built upon this work, our future work can focus on building informatics tools to support the long-term surveillance and health monitoring of SGMs using large-scale national networks of EHRs.",Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals,10056679,R21CA245858,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Burden', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coin', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hormone use', 'Hospitals', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer statistics', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'gender nonconforming', 'health care service organization', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'informatics tool', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population based', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening program', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'stem', 'structured data', 'study population', 'transgender']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,392115,0.005319987922022404
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9850545,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,617785,0.1939778835202958
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9979779,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,745481,0.03925990116146956
"Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The long-term goal of our proposed project is to reduce the population burden of CRC by providing the information needed to address key policy questions across the CRC control continuum in an accessible and transparent manner. To accomplish this goal we will use our population-based microsimulation models to: 1) Evaluate the impact of screening as practiced in the US; 2) Inform the debate about the increase in CRC incidence before age 50; 3) Consider the effectiveness of precision of screening and surveillance; 4) Address other emerging issues and opportunities in CRC control; and 5) Use novel methods to improve model accessibility and transparency. Our team will fill critical gaps in knowledge, enabling decision makers to act. New evidence that we will incorporate in our models to better inform CRC control opportunities will be 1) updated information on screening patterns in the US (in collaboration with the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimen, or PROSPR), 2) data on the increased risk of CRC in persons under age 50 (in collaboration with Rebecca Siegal of the American Cancer Society, who did the seminal work in this area), and 3) state-of-the art colonoscopy screening data to incorporate alternative carcinogenesis pathways in the natural history models (in collaboration with the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry). We will synthesize and incorporate the growing body of evidence in the literature to assess the clinical utility of personalized screening and treatment, as well as the potential role for novel computer-aided detection and diagnosis modalities. We will expand our models to project clinical and resource-based outcomes for middle-income countries that are considering the implementation of a screening program. Lastly, there is a critical need to make our models assessible and transparent. To this end we will use high performance computing approaches to develop and apply deep- learning methods for model calibration and model emulation, which will aid in model sharing. The three participating modeling groups are well positioned to carry out this work, bringing a wealth of experience, expertise, and insight to issues related to microsimulation modeling of CRC, and have a proven track record of collaboration and disseminating our work to health policy decision makers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite large increases in screening in the past two decades, colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Our research has shown that 60% of these deaths could be prevented by better use of available screening interventions.

"Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test ABSTRACT The HPV vaccine is highly effective in clinical trials, with an absolute risk of persistent (6+ months) infection with vaccine-type high-risk HPV of only 1.4% among vaccinated women. As prevalence of HPV infection decreases, the risk of false positive cervical cancer screening results increases. However, current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Data cannot be extrapolated from other countries with different HPV vaccination coverage, as cross-protection against non- vaccine type HPV infection varies by population vaccination rates, and are likely to affect screening test performance. Major challenges in development of new U.S. guidelines are anticipated for the following reasons: 1) large U.S. population-based data on HPV infection rates and cervical cancer screening test statistics are currently not available, and likely vary by regional vaccination rates; 2) most studies evaluating cervical cancer screening results in vaccinated women do not differentiate between those who have received only 1 dose of the vaccine and those who have completed the 2-3 dose series; 3) few studies have evaluated differences in outcomes by age at HPV vaccine initiation or interval between doses. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to determine an optimal cervical cancer screening strategy for women vaccinated against HPV. The objectives of this pilot research are to 1) determine if the prevalence of cervical dysplasia has decreased with HPV vaccination and resultantly changed the PPV of cervical cancer screening tests, and 2) determine if cervical cancer screening test performance varies by age at HPV vaccine initiation, number of doses, or interval between HPV vaccine doses. Aim1: Determine if the decrease in prevalence of cervical dysplasia among vaccinated women has resulted in a decrease in the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests. A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare cervical cancer screening and diagnostic test results among HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Positive predictive values for positive HPV tests and abnormal cytology results to predict high-grade dysplasia will be compared by HPV vaccination status. Aim2: Determine if cervical cancer screening test accuracy varies by age at vaccine initiation, number of doses received, and/or interval between doses. The positive predictive value of positive HPV tests and abnormal Pap test results among vaccinated women will be compared by the number of vaccine doses received (1 vs. 2+), age at vaccine initiation, and interval between doses using logistic regression. Project Narrative Current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between women who have and have not been vaccinated to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. United States data to inform changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines for vaccinated women are urgently needed to ensure that harms of screening these women at low risk for cancer do not outweigh the benefits. The results of this research will provide an estimate of the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests (Pap tests, HPV tests) post-vaccination, and define a population of women who are adequately vaccinated (based on age at vaccine initiation, number of vaccine doses, and interval between doses) to benefit from what will likely be decreased cervical cancer screening without significant increase in cancer risk.",Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test,9806021,R03HS026982,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2019,54765,0.010091001531574974
"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9741106,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2019,158153,0.1501205117697242
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9766215,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2019,171720,0.1424142379658928
"Combinatorial Biomarkers for Malignant Polyps and Colon Cancer Detection ABSTRACT Technological advancements in colonoscopic and polypectomy procedures have drastically reduced both the incidence and overall mortality due to colorectal cancer (CRC). However, even with the availability of multiple screening tools, only 40% of CRC are diagnosed at early stage, in part due to lack of compliance with follow-up colonoscopy procedure, limited access to colonoscopy. These factors contribute to inappropriate surveillance follow-up as well as development of `interval cancer' within 5-years of a completely negative colonoscopy. Histological characteristic of polypectized polyps (high-risk vs. low-risk) is among major criterion for follow-up surveillance colonoscopy. Given that current surveillance recommendations depend on the histologic type of the polyp, the underdiagnoses of these premalignant precursors often leads to inappropriate follow-up care and therapy, thus contributing to CRC. Our initial screening has identified that a combination of markers i.e. MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19-9 that accurately differentiate benign hyperplastic polyp (HP) from pre-malignant sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P) and tubular adenoma (TA). Based on preliminary studies and the identified gaps in diagnosis, we hypothesize that this newly identified marker panel of MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9 can accurately classify the major colorectal polyp subtypes, and in conjunction with machine learning tools can provide an economical product for improved patient stratification for better surveillance and prevention of CRC. To meet these milestones, two specific aims are proposed: aim 1 is designed to evaluate the potential of MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9 for effective stratification of benign from malignant polyps. The major milestones for this aim is the development of a MUC17, MUC5AC, and CA19.9 immunostaining kit and to evaluate the potential of the combination for differentiating HP, SSA/P and TA in highly suspicious cases with documented inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. Further, aim 2 focuses on the development of polyp differentiation deep learning computational program based upon histology, tissue markers (MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9), polyp size, number, and location (the most critical parameters for deciding the interval of surveillance colonoscopy) for accurate surveillance of CRC by colonoscopy. The major milestone is to develop and evaluate the colon cancer polyp stratification algorithm in an independent patient set. Overall, the present phase I SBIR application seeks to advance the CRC field by simplifying and improving CRC precursor classification, thus improving the ease of polyp classification which can facilitate better recommendations for follow-up surveillance colonoscopy. This should in turn further reduce the healthcare burden by improving patient adherence for CRC management, to reduce deaths from CRC. Altogether, results from Phase 1 will lead to validation in a multi-center trial and validation in a clinical setting (CLIA lab) during phase II to form the basis to seek FDA approval of this test for use in hospital testing to provide accurate classification of premalignant polyps. PROJECT NARRATIVE With only 40% of patient diagnosed at an early stage, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths.

"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9658032,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,356700,0.13169421122183964
"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9618151,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,628904,0.1939778835202958
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9894990,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'education resources', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'patient portal', 'polyposis', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,707923,0.12705061473138904
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9749060,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,733691,0.03925990116146956
"The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes ABSTRACT Growing evidence shows that hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of cancer patients, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom results can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can also have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families. AYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental and emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from AYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior change. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and considering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer. These factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations – sometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test an AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric psychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening Education), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate genetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal, serving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information. Iterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to conducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are: Aim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers. Aim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine impact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological distress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care. Aim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot and patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination. If successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of patients with incident cancers, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs).

"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9599316,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2018,158153,0.1501205117697242
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9543446,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2018,171720,0.1424142379658928
"Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality and approximately 5% of individuals will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes. However, colorectal cancer is highly preventable if detected early. Colonoscopies are the most common form of colorectal cancer screenings and all adults between the ages of 50 and 74 are recommended to receive a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years. This study will examine how two recent policies, coverage mandates and high-deductible health plans, that change consumer cost-sharing for colonoscopies have changed patient adherence to these guidelines among the commercially insured population. This study will also examine how changes in patient utilization of colonoscopies have led to changes in colorectal cancer detection and mortality. These policies have created a rapidly changing cost- sharing environment for patients and so fully understanding the patient health effects of these policies is will help inform policy makers on the patient health effects of these changes. Recent years have also seen a rapid increase in data, computing power, and analytical methodologies. This study will apply recent advances in data mining techniques to one of the largest sources of data available to researchers. The machine learning approaches used in this study will two sources of bias that are potentially present in traditional approaches—multiple hypothesis testing and selective reporting of results. The machine learning model approaches will also be used to estimate heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will help inform policy makers of how to tailor cost-sharing policies for colonoscopy services. Several recent policies have substantially changed consumer cost-sharing for screening colonoscopy services, which are highly effective in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer, among the commercially insured population. Very little is known about if this rapidly changing environment changes the utilization of preventive cancer screening. This study aims to apply recent advances in machine learning and data mining to fill this knowledge gap and examine if recent changes in coverage mandates and insurance benefit design have affected colonoscopy utilization and patient health.",Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health,9502260,R21CA219229,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Econometric Models', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surgical complication', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'health plan', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'screening', 'treatment effect']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,205694,0.09987275997349371
"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9407289,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,674450,0.1939778835202958
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9534547,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2018,752888,0.03925990116146956

"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9352810,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2017,67563,0.1424142379658928
"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the United States, about 136,000 new cases diagnosed and 50,000 dying from the disease each year. CRC racial disparities (26% higher incidence among Blacks and 52% higher mortality) have persisted at pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Nearly 60% of both Whites and Blacks are now covered by colonoscopy screening. Current screening recommendations (initiation of screening at 50 years of age regardless of race) are driven by an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are largely due to differences in access to screening and the quality of post diagnostic care.  However, in younger age groups, Blacks have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Assuming that most CRCs arise from precancerous polyps that evolve into cancer, it is plausible that Blacks experience earlier polyp initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent CRC disparities may be the race-neutral age guideline for screening initiation. However there is no direct evidence regarding age-related Black-White differences in precancerous polyps and the indicators of progression through the intermediate stages (polyp size and dysplastic histology). To establish such evidence, it requires a data source representing the polyp prevalence and profile in the population. In the absence of a large enough autopsy study, the next best alternative is a colonoscopy series validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance, and having complete polyp documentation. No such data source has been available so far.  Our study will leverage a unique polyp database generated by a previous NIH-funded study. It represents the nearest possible proxy to the population polyp prevalence and profile, and has sufficient statistical power to compare Blacks and Whites on polyp prevalence and cancer-relevant features within age strata. It is a large and well-documented database of a single-center colonoscopy series which is externally validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance: this cohort experienced 83% CRC incidence reduction and 89% CRC mortality reduction relative to the general South Carolina population over a 4.9-year of follow-up period. The rates are similar to those of the only colonoscopy clinical trial so far.  We will use data on ~17,681 colonoscopy patients with ~32,900 polyps (54% Black), and CRC data on this cohort obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. We will study Black-White differences within 5-10 year age strata in: the presence of polyps, polyp number and features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and cancer), as well as combinations of these factors. We will use univariate statistical tests, multiple regressio (binary and ordered polynomial logistic regression, linear and Poisson regression) and cluster analysis. We will use sensitivity analyses to account for potential bias in the sample. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) have remained unabated from pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Studies suggest the plausibility of earlier initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer among Blacks although direct evidence is lacking. This study will explore a unique dataset generated by a previous study to investigate this question and could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age and frequency for Blacks with implications for reducing CRC racial disparities.",Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile,9195710,R21CA202477,"['Age', 'Age-Years', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Carpet', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Documentation', 'Dysplasia', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Histology', 'Hyperplasia', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Polynomial Models', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Precancerous Polyp', 'Premalignant', 'Prevalence', 'Proxy', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'South Carolina', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Villous', 'adenoma', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'early experience', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'male', 'mortality', 'mortality disparity', 'neoplasm registry', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2017,130070,0.19627409424085526
"Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality and approximately 5% of individuals will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes. However, colorectal cancer is highly preventable if detected early. Colonoscopies are the most common form of colorectal cancer screenings and all adults between the ages of 50 and 74 are recommended to receive a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years. This study will examine how two recent policies, coverage mandates and high-deductible health plans, that change consumer cost-sharing for colonoscopies have changed patient adherence to these guidelines among the commercially insured population. This study will also examine how changes in patient utilization of colonoscopies have led to changes in colorectal cancer detection and mortality. These policies have created a rapidly changing cost- sharing environment for patients and so fully understanding the patient health effects of these policies is will help inform policy makers on the patient health effects of these changes. Recent years have also seen a rapid increase in data, computing power, and analytical methodologies. This study will apply recent advances in data mining techniques to one of the largest sources of data available to researchers. The machine learning approaches used in this study will two sources of bias that are potentially present in traditional approaches—multiple hypothesis testing and selective reporting of results. The machine learning model approaches will also be used to estimate heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will help inform policy makers of how to tailor cost-sharing policies for colonoscopy services. Several recent policies have substantially changed consumer cost-sharing for screening colonoscopy services, which are highly effective in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer, among the commercially insured population. Very little is known about if this rapidly changing environment changes the utilization of preventive cancer screening. This study aims to apply recent advances in machine learning and data mining to fill this knowledge gap and examine if recent changes in coverage mandates and insurance benefit design have affected colonoscopy utilization and patient health.",Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health,9373907,R21CA219229,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Econometric Models', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surgical complication', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'treatment effect']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,208522,0.09987275997349371
"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9237818,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,738377,0.1939778835202958
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9295773,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2017,766250,0.03925990116146956
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.

"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNAs in a large set of population-based cases. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the United States, about 136,000 new cases diagnosed and 50,000 dying from the disease each year. CRC racial disparities (26% higher incidence among Blacks and 52% higher mortality) have persisted at pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Nearly 60% of both Whites and Blacks are now covered by colonoscopy screening. Current screening recommendations (initiation of screening at 50 years of age regardless of race) are driven by an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are largely due to differences in access to screening and the quality of post diagnostic care.  However, in younger age groups, Blacks have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Assuming that most CRCs arise from precancerous polyps that evolve into cancer, it is plausible that Blacks experience earlier polyp initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent CRC disparities may be the race-neutral age guideline for screening initiation. However there is no direct evidence regarding age-related Black-White differences in precancerous polyps and the indicators of progression through the intermediate stages (polyp size and dysplastic histology). To establish such evidence, it requires a data source representing the polyp prevalence and profile in the population. In the absence of a large enough autopsy study, the next best alternative is a colonoscopy series validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance, and having complete polyp documentation. No such data source has been available so far.  Our study will leverage a unique polyp database generated by a previous NIH-funded study. It represents the nearest possible proxy to the population polyp prevalence and profile, and has sufficient statistical power to compare Blacks and Whites on polyp prevalence and cancer-relevant features within age strata. It is a large and well-documented database of a single-center colonoscopy series which is externally validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance: this cohort experienced 83% CRC incidence reduction and 89% CRC mortality reduction relative to the general South Carolina population over a 4.9-year of follow-up period. The rates are similar to those of the only colonoscopy clinical trial so far.  We will use data on ~17,681 colonoscopy patients with ~32,900 polyps (54% Black), and CRC data on this cohort obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. We will study Black-White differences within 5-10 year age strata in: the presence of polyps, polyp number and features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and cancer), as well as combinations of these factors. We will use univariate statistical tests, multiple regressio (binary and ordered polynomial logistic regression, linear and Poisson regression) and cluster analysis. We will use sensitivity analyses to account for potential bias in the sample. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) have remained unabated from pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Studies suggest the plausibility of earlier initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer among Blacks although direct evidence is lacking. This study will explore a unique dataset generated by a previous study to investigate this question and could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age and frequency for Blacks with implications for reducing CRC racial disparities.",Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile,9343096,R21CA202477,"['10 year old', 'Accounting', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Carpet', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Documentation', 'Dysplasia', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Hyperplasia', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Polynomial Models', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Precancerous Polyp', 'Premalignant', 'Prevalence', 'Proxy', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'South Carolina', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Villous', 'adenoma', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cancer survival', 'cohort', 'early experience', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'male', 'mortality', 'mortality disparity', 'neoplasm registry', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'screening']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2016,128345,0.19627409424085526
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9224101,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2016,177057,0.1424142379658928

"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,9122340,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'racial and ethnic', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,386725,0.051786986570409

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9134844,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Community of Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2016,996374,0.12705061473138904
"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process.

"DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly half of all cancers cases might be avoided if people were to engage in healthy lifestyle and early detection behaviors. A central tenet of theories of health behavior is that awareness of a threat is an important condition for protective action. Empirical evidence supports the idea that higher perceptions of risk motivate people to engage in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Consequently, an important component of cancer surveillance has been assessing the population's perceptions of risk of developing cancer. Health promotion and education campaigns that seek to promote cancer prevention and early detection behaviors often attempt to increase the public's sense of personal risk of developing cancer. In order to optimize surveillance and develop health education and promotion campaigns that engage those at greatest risk for not engaging in protective behaviors, it is important that we understand the relationship between perceived risk and health behavior for all research respondents. Currently this is not the case. Our research found that at least 16 million people in the U.S. would respond I don't know if asked their perceived risk of developing cancer. Many of these people are members of populations that experience cancer disparities. Little is known about the health behaviors of these individuals because people who respond don't know have typically been dropped from analyses. Thus, these individuals have been systematically excluded from much cancer prevention research. However, if, as our preliminary         research suggests, they are unaware of their cancer risk (or unable or unwilling to report it), the may be at increased risk for not engaging in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Therefore, understanding the relation of don't know responding to engaging in preventive health behavior is a critical research need. To test the hypothesis that don't know responding is associated with lower engagement in cancer prevention and detection behaviors, we will examine the association between don't know responding to risk perception questions and a wide variety of cancer prevention behaviors in 14 large, population-based surveys (i.e., multiple years of NHIS, HINTS, and BRFSS). Specific behaviors include physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, skin protection, HPV vaccination, cancer screening (breast, colorectal, prostate), and, because AIDS is a risk factor for several cancers, HIV testing. Multivariate linear and logistic regression will be used to estimate the relation between don't know responding to perceived risk questions and engaging in a given cancer prevention or early detection behavior, after controlling for demographic characteristics. This research will address a gap in knowledge about the health behaviors of the 7-10% of U.S. adults -- more than 16 million people -- who respond don't know to cancer risk perception survey questions. The study will also advance our knowledge of why existing intervention approaches may be ineffective for certain populations that experience cancer disparities, as well as identify potential intervention components and target populations for such interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that, when asked about their risk of cancer, over 16 million adults in the U.S. respond I don't know. This study will test whether these individuals are at risk for not engaging in behaviors that prevent and detect cancer, including cancer screening, physical activity, avoiding tobacco, obtaining HPV vaccination, and eating adequate fruits and vegetables. Findings will indicate whether people who respond don't know are a high risk group that may need to be engaged with targeted health education and promotion.",DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR,8786066,R03CA177775,"['AIDS prevention', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Prevention Intervention', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Health behavior', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Skin', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fruits and vegetables', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'risk perception', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'therapy development']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,83928,0.006048526238765521
"Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that sessile serrated polyps (SSPs), flat, colonic lesions with architectural abnormalities at the base of crypts and a serrated appearance, may be important precursors to colorectal cancer. Previously, advanced adenomas were the only known polyp precursors for colorectal cancer, and SSPs were clinically grouped with hyperplastic polyps, lesions routinely believed to have no malignant potential. Now, there is growing consensus that SSPs progress to cancer along the ""serrated pathway"". New guidelines were developed in 2012 recommending complete removal of SSPs and increased colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with a history of SSPs. However, these guidelines acknowledge that these new recommendations are largely based on cross-sectional data, with the only longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs limited by size (n=40). Therefore, the primary objective of this application is to gather preliminary data to estimate the risk of colorectal cancer in a large cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed SSPs. We will address the following specific aims: 1) compare the risk of subsequent colorectal cancer in patients who had SSPs diagnosed at an index colonoscopy to patients with advanced adenomas, and estimate the time to cancer progression in both polyp groups; 2) among those with SSPs at index colonoscopy, evaluate whether risk of incident colorectal cancer varies according to size and location of the index SSP. To accomplish these aims, we propose a cohort study of 2,250 patients evaluated via an index colonoscopy between 2003 and 2011 at the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic and diagnosed with SSPs (N=750) or advanced adenomas (N=1,500). Using University of Washington's established Microsoft Amalga data aggregation platform, which links electronic medical records data across different sources, we have already identified our study cohort. Additional medical informatics and natural language processing will be used to electronically extract data on patient characteristics, and index polyp size and location. Then, we will electronically follow-up patients for incident colorectal cancer through December 2012 by linking our study cohort to the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registry (SEER), a population based cancer registry covering western Washington State, including the catchment area for the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic patient population. Cox regression models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of colorectal cancer risk comparing patients with SSPs to those with advanced adenomas (Aim 1) and to estimate colorectal cancer risk between patients with different polyp characteristics among those with SSPs (Aim 2). This will be the largest longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs to date and the first study in a colonoscopy-based cohort to estimate incidence of colorectal cancer in those with SSPs diagnosed though usual care in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to determine the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps. New research links these polyps to a subset of colorectal cancer that tends to be missed during cancer screening. Understanding the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps will inform decisions about the management of these patients and ultimately improve the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening.",Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort,8831625,R03CA186215,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biometry', 'Caliber', 'Catchment Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serrated Adenoma', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'hazard', 'improved', 'indexing', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor progression']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R03,2015,88000,0.11720946608245715
"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8893927,R21CA187877,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cost Savings', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal aorta', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer patients', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2015,189225,0.04898553642546844
"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8930929,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,428238,0.051786986570409
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA.

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.                ","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",8965736,U01HG008657,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2015,859799,0.12705061473138904
"Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that sessile serrated polyps (SSPs), flat, colonic lesions with architectural abnormalities at the base of crypts and a serrated appearance, may be important precursors to colorectal cancer. Previously, advanced adenomas were the only known polyp precursors for colorectal cancer, and SSPs were clinically grouped with hyperplastic polyps, lesions routinely believed to have no malignant potential. Now, there is growing consensus that SSPs progress to cancer along the ""serrated pathway"". New guidelines were developed in 2012 recommending complete removal of SSPs and increased colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with a history of SSPs. However, these guidelines acknowledge that these new recommendations are largely based on cross-sectional data, with the only longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs limited by size (n=40). Therefore, the primary objective of this application is to gather preliminary data to estimate the risk of colorectal cancer in a large cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed SSPs. We will address the following specific aims: 1) compare the risk of subsequent colorectal cancer in patients who had SSPs diagnosed at an index colonoscopy to patients with advanced adenomas, and estimate the time to cancer progression in both polyp groups; 2) among those with SSPs at index colonoscopy, evaluate whether risk of incident colorectal cancer varies according to size and location of the index SSP. To accomplish these aims, we propose a cohort study of 2,250 patients evaluated via an index colonoscopy between 2003 and 2011 at the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic and diagnosed with SSPs (N=750) or advanced adenomas (N=1,500). Using University of Washington's established Microsoft Amalga data aggregation platform, which links electronic medical records data across different sources, we have already identified our study cohort. Additional medical informatics and natural language processing will be used to electronically extract data on patient characteristics, and index polyp size and location. Then, we will electronically follow-up patients for incident colorectal cancer through December 2012 by linking our study cohort to the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registry (SEER), a population based cancer registry covering western Washington State, including the catchment area for the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic patient population. Cox regression models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of colorectal cancer risk comparing patients with SSPs to those with advanced adenomas (Aim 1) and to estimate colorectal cancer risk between patients with different polyp characteristics among those with SSPs (Aim 2). This will be the largest longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs to date and the first study in a colonoscopy-based cohort to estimate incidence of colorectal cancer in those with SSPs diagnosed though usual care in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to determine the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps. New research links these polyps to a subset of colorectal cancer that tends to be missed during cancer screening. Understanding the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps will inform decisions about the management of these patients and ultimately improve the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening.            ",Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort,8704474,R03CA186215,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biometry', 'Caliber', 'Catchment Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serrated Adenoma', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'hazard', 'improved', 'indexing', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor progression']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R03,2014,88000,0.11720946608245715
"DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR  Nearly half of all cancers cases might be avoided if people were to engage in healthy lifestyle and early detection behaviors. A central tenet of theories of health behavior is that awareness of a threat is an important condition for protective action. Empirical evidence supports the idea that higher perceptions of risk motivate people to engage in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Consequently, an important component of cancer surveillance has been assessing the population's perceptions of risk of developing cancer. Health promotion and education campaigns that seek to promote cancer prevention and early detection behaviors often attempt to increase the public's sense of personal risk of developing cancer. In order to optimize surveillance and develop health education and promotion campaigns that engage those at greatest risk for not engaging in protective behaviors, it is important that we understand the relationship between perceived risk and health behavior for all research respondents. Currently this is not the case. Our research found that at least 16 million people in the U.S. would respond I don't know if asked their perceived risk of developing cancer. Many of these people are members of populations that experience cancer disparities. Little is known about the health behaviors of these individuals because people who respond don't know have typically been dropped from analyses. Thus, these individuals have been systematically excluded from much cancer prevention research. However, if, as our preliminary research suggests, they are unaware of their cancer risk (or unable or unwilling to report it), they may be at increased risk for not engaging in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Therefore, understanding the relation of don't know responding to engaging in preventive health behavior is a critical research need. To test the hypothesis that don't know responding is associated with lower engagement in cancer prevention and detection behaviors, we will examine the association between don't know responding to risk perception questions and a wide variety of cancer prevention behaviors in 14 large, population-based surveys (i.e., multiple years of NHIS, HINTS, and BRFSS). Specific behaviors include physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, skin protection, HPV vaccination, cancer screening (breast, colorectal, prostate), and, because AIDS is a risk factor for several cancers, HIV testing. Multivariate linear and logistic regression will be used to estimate the relation between don't know responding to perceived risk questions and engaging in a given cancer prevention or early detection behavior, after controlling for demographic characteristics. This research will address a gap in knowledge about the health behaviors of the 7-10% of U.S. adults-more than 16 million people-who respond don't know to cancer risk perception survey questions. The study will also advance our knowledge of why existing intervention approaches may be ineffective for certain populations that experience cancer disparities, as well as identify potential intervention components and target populations for such interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that, when asked about their risk of cancer, over 16 million adults in the U.S. respond I don't know. This study will test whether these individuals are at risk for not engaging in behaviors that prevent and detect cancer, including cancer screening, physical activity, avoiding tobacco, obtaining HPV vaccination, and eating adequate fruits and vegetables. Findings will indicate whether people who respond don't know are a high risk group that may need to be engaged with targeted health education and promotion.            ",DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR,8633184,R03CA177775,"['AIDS prevention', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Prevention Intervention', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Health behavior', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Skin', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fruits and vegetables', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'therapy development']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,102407,0.006084020919817781
"Virtual Fly-Over Colonoscopy System for Clinical Test-SBIR Phase 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Yet, if polyps are detected and removed early, colorectal cancer is largely preventable. Although optical colonoscopy (OC), the current gold standard, detects more than 90% of colorectal neoplasms; it is invasive and can be uncomfortable, inconvenient, and perceived as undesirable by patients. Furthermore, even experienced endoscopists may have difficulty reaching the cecum, resulting in incomplete visualizations of the colon. As a consequence, virtual colonoscopy (VC) has emerged as an alternative to OC. During VC, a virtual camera is used to view the internal walls of a virtual colon, reconstructed from CT scans of the abdominal cavity. However, current VC systems have had limited clinical appeal, as they are limited to specific types of polyps, may generate a large number of false positives, or have poor detection rates for significant polyps in the size range of 5-9 mm. The new technology we propose to commercialize through this SBIR work is a game changing, patented, visualization technique for VC, called the ""virtual fly-over"" technique. The technique is sensitive, effective, and efficient for detecting colon polyps. The overall objective of this proposal is to complete the development and validation of a novel visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy, which was patented by the University of Louisville. The hypothesis is that the new visualization technique will enable better viewing of the complex colonic topology, and hence a better capability to detect polyps, especially those that may be hidden behind haustral folds. The current prototype has been utilized to evaluate twenty clinical datasets, with excellent results. However, artifact removal and user friendly features must be incorporated prior to Phase II, in which the technology will be utilized in a larg scale clinical validation trial leading to a commercial product. Also, we propose to (1) generate more convincing preliminary data in a pilot study of 160 datasets, and (2) introduce several phantom polyps, in the size range of 5-9 mm, into the clinical datasets, in order to provide statistical significance of the technology's effectiveness. The phantom polyps will be placed in traditionally difficult-to-analyze positions, which pose significant detection problems for both OC and current VC methods. According to the literature, current OC methods result in a 61-91% (average 80%) viewing of the Colon. The University of Louisville's work in the ""fly-through VC method"", which mimics classic OC, results in 93.4 percent viewing, and the new ""fly-over"" method results in 97.5% percent viewing. Even more important is the improved point of view (""eye-in-the-sky""), the lack of optical distortion, and enhanced CAD functionality that will increase polyp recognition dramatically, especially when detecting small colon polyps, polyps hidden behind haustral folds, and polyps in folded colonic segments at anatomical inflection points. We anticipate the overall improvement in the ability to visualize difficult polyps to be upwards of 30% compared to today's methods, and we are excited about commercializing this technology with the University of Louisville.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US with only approximately 50% of the eligible population take advantage of current screening methods. The importance of this proposed technology is the early detection of colon cancer, in an acceptable manner that the general population will agree to, and without the associated morbidity of sedation that is required for the vast majority of endoscopic colonoscopy. We believe our technology has the potential to serve as a foundation for a huge step forward in automating and facilitating large scale screening of human colons, providing a more effective and much more acceptable method to the general population, than the currently invasive optical colonoscopy, which 50 % of the population still refuses to undergo.

"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit  temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8757781,R21CA187877,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cost Savings', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal aorta', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'response']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2014,227070,0.04898553642546844
"Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies widely across the population. Statistical models have shown that there must be wide variation in the underlying 'familial risk profile' necessary to explain the well-established familial risks of CRC. On top of this, CRC risk is determined by personal characteristics and exposures to many environmental factors. Current screening guidelines use only age and rudimentary metrics of family history to stratify individuals to different regimens. To date, there are no CRC risk prediction models that integrate data on family history (including ages, ages at diagnoses, and relationships across multiple generations) and all known genetic factors, let alone environmental factors and personal characteristics associated with CRC risk. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model that will deliver an accurate individual risk prediction across the full spectrum of risk by using explicit family history data, as well as data on the presence or absence of all known genetic and environmental risk factors. This model will facilitate more appropriate screening recommendations to reduce the burden of disease. We will do this using data from a fully characterized, population-based study with comprehensively measured known and suspected risk factors including personal characteristics, environmental risk factors, complex family history, and measured genetic variants. We have at our disposal the Colon Cancer Family Registry, a large, prospective, international resource of families and individuals who span the continuum of risk for CRC, recruited from the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand since 1998. Participants have: (i) been tested for mutations in the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) and MUTYH, and measured for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with CRC; (ii) provided a multi-generational pedigree and family cancer history which has been validated where possible; and (iii) completed a risk factor questionnaire at baseline and every five years. We will accomplish our goal by addressing two aims. The first is to develop the CRC risk prediction model using measured genetic information, the multi-generational cancer family history data, and the information on all known risk factors. We will apply segregation analysis and logistic regression to data from 29,701 individuals from 12,902 population-based families. The second aim is to test the validity of the CRC risk prediction model and to determine its incremental value over existing models using prospective data. We will determine how well, in terms of calibration and predictive capacity, the model's predicted CRC risks (based on their baseline data) predict the CRC diagnoses occurring during the follow-up of the sub-cohort individuals with no history of CRC at baseline (19,390 with five-year follow-up of which 8,657 have 10-year follow-up). This comprehensive CRC risk prediction model will have many uses, including helping the development of targeted, population-wide screening strategies in which recommendations as to initiation age, frequency and modality, are tailored appropriately to predicted risks so as to increase the value and cost-effectiveness of screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop a comprehensive CRC risk prediction model that will accurately stratify individuals according to their levels of risk, basedon all known risk factors including genetic, environmental and personal characteristics. This model will aid the development of more appropriate screening recommendations and facilitate the application of mutation testing in a more effective manner. Our model is timely and offers the potential to change clinical practice and direct public health initiatives by moving resources to those people more likely to benefit from specific surveillance protocols or genetic tests.",Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction,8720722,R01CA170122,"['Address', 'Age', 'Australia', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family Characteristics', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MLH1 gene', 'MSH2 gene', 'MSH6 gene', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'New Zealand', 'PMS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer family registry', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'segregation']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,280342,0.12800475176176462
"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening. We have found several candidate regions that contain genetic risk factors in African Americans. These and other regions have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk by validated genetic associations. We will determine the functional genetic variants that increase risk by genetic and functional studies. These studies will have important implications for early detection and possibly therapeutic intervention among African Americans.",Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients,8705888,U01CA153060,"['15q23', '8q24', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'African American', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell model', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luciferases', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Targeted Resequencing', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'design', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro Assay', 'mortality', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,U01,2014,405510,0.13328881064337603
"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.                ",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8693710,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,504210,0.051786986570409
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer.           n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8727268,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,523201,0.1714463349906324
"Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer prevention processes are rapidly transforming. Changes in guidelines, and resulting changes in practice, stem from breakthroughs in basic research on cervical cancer and technological advances in testing, diagnosis, and prevention. For example discovery of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis has led to         development of HPV vaccines and recommendations for their use in the general public. As cervical cancer prevention practices change, we face widening gaps in our knowledge about the impact of these changes on women's health, that is, the balance of risk and harms affected by newly recommended screening intervals, and how this balance differs for vaccinated and unvaccinated women. We also need more information about barriers to screening uptake and adherence to guidelines screening intervals. To address these gaps, we propose supplementing our Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS) PROSPR Research Center with a Cervical Cancer Unit that will collect population-based data and work with the PROSPR network to guide studies of the cervical cancer screening process. Our study team, located at Group Health Research Institute, has access to extensive data from Group Health, a health care and coverage system in Washington State. Multilevel data are available from patients (e.g., characteristics, screening dates, cancer outcomes), providers (e.g., specialty), and facilities that include both health system owned-and-operated clinics and contracted community affiliates. Group Health members represent a diverse population of patients who receive care under a range of insurance coverage programs available in the US, ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to new plans offered beginning January 1, 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Our study team is well positioned to carry out this proposed work. We are already closely linked to Group Health clinical providers, and have a breadth and depth of experience in cervical cancer screening research that includes knowledge of Group Health data systems and methods for extracting information from these systems, and up-to-date methodology including study design and analysis of complex data.         Public Health Relevance:  Cervical cancer screening recommendations have undergone dramatic changes, shifting from annual Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to 2- to 3-year rescreening intervals, and incorporating HPV DNA testing. This supplement to our PROSPR Research Center will enable our team to provide population-level data to improve our understanding of the benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening as practiced.                ",Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS),8791225,U54CA163261,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Commit', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cytopathology', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Equilibrium', 'Face', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Northwestern United States', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'anticancer research', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'care delivery', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized data processing', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'population health', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'stem', 'uptake']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U54,2014,649872,0.08255004836079635
"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNAs in a large set of population-based cases. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.          Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC (colorectal cancer) and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNA expression and mutation in a large sample of population-based cases. Having data available on polyps from those cases who developed cancer, will help us determine ""drivers"" vs. ""passengers"" in the carcinogenic process.

"Measurement of Inappropriate Screening Tests (MIST)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although routine screening can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, some screened patients may not be appropriate for screening. We define inappropriate screening as screening at intervals that are shorter than recommended by guidelines, screening high-risk patients with a method other than colonoscopy, and screening when the patient is unlikely to benefit because they are under age 50 over age 85 or of have a life expectancy of less than 5 years. Inappropriate CRC screening strains scarce gastroenterology resources, increases costs of healthcare, and exposes patients to inconvenience, stress and medical risks, including death. Little is known about the prevalence of inappropriate screening beyond single site estimates. Nor do we know about inter-facility variation or its causes. Both computerized clinical reminders (CCRs) which are used to prompt providers when a patient is due for screening, and CRC screening performance measure scores have been identified as important interventions to promote CRC screening. However, CCRs may contribute to over-screening if they do not facilitate critical evaluation of appropriateness, and performance measures may contribute to overuse by encouraging indiscriminate screening practices. Aims. The objective of this research is to improve the quality of CRC screening programs by minimizing the number of patients who receive inappropriate screening tests while maintaining high rates of appropriate CRC screening. This grant will quantify the extent of inappropriate screening in a large integrated health care system. It will also test hypotheses regarding the association of inappropriate CRC screening rates with facility CRC screening performance measure scores and CCR characteristics (i.e., whether the CCR contains input fields to document a rationale for not recommending screening). Approach. This one-year observational study will begin by identifying patients who had a CRC screening test at any Veterans Health Administration facility (n=139) in fiscal year 2010. An algorithm, developed for this study, will be applied to the administrative data to classify each screening procedure as inappropriate or appropriate based on patient demographics, screening history, and health status. To reduce error associated with automated classification, a manual chart review on a subsample of 10 patients from each of 32 facilities will be conducted. Predictive modeling and multiple imputation techniques will then be used to identify predictors of misclassification and to reclassify cases from the full sample that are identified as likely to have been initially misclassified. Facility estimates of inappropriate screening obtained from these analyses will then be entered as dependent variables into hierarchical logistic regression models to test proposed hypotheses regarding the relationships between facility CCR characteristics, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based performance measure scores, and inappropriate CRC screening.          This project will quantify the extent of inappropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within a large US healthcare system, examine relationships between inappropriate CRC screening and characteristics of facility CRC screening computerized clinical reminders, and test for an association between inappropriate screening and facility Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based CRC screening performance measure scores. Through this work we expect to identify improvements to current CRC screening strategies that will reduce the number of unnecessary procedures conducted on patients who are unlikely to benefit, while still facilitating CRC screening for those who are screening appropriate.

"Mitochondria as a novel biomarker of colorectal adenoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although early detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, the precursors of most colorectal cancers, has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer, the disease remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We recently found that increased circulating concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers are associated with increased colorectal adenoma risk. Mitochondria (Mt) are the predominant source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a major cause of endogenous oxidative stress. Mitochondrial variations (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) have been associated with increased ROS production. Despite the central role for mitochondria in ROS production, their role in pathogenesis of colorectal adenomas has not been evaluated. We hypothesize that mtDNA copy number and germline variations in the mitochondrial genome will be associated with colorectal adenoma risk. We propose to evaluate this hypothesis by measuring mtDNA copy number using real time polymerase chain reaction and genotyping mitochondrial tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) and D-loop polymorphisms in 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls collected from three methodologically very similar, colonoscopy-based case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas. We will use unconditional logistic regression to analyze the association between mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial polymorphisms and colorectal adenoma risk. This innovative epidemiologic study seeks to translate our understanding of mitochondrial biology into discovery of novel mitochondrial biomarkers that can inform strategies for the primary prevention of colorectal adenoma. Findings from this exploratory study will provide preliminary data to design a prospective study with adequate sample size to confirm the findings from this study and comprehensively evaluate the role of mitochondria in colorectal cancer etiology.          This application aims to evaluate the association between mitochondrial variants (mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) and risk of colorectal adenoma is an existing dataset of 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to further our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental/lifestyle factors that affect risk for incident, sporadic colorectal cancer.

"Virtual Fly-Over Colonoscopy System for Clinical Test-SBIR Phase 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Yet, if polyps are detected and removed early, colorectal cancer is largely preventable. Although optical colonoscopy (OC), the current gold standard, detects more than 90% of colorectal neoplasms; it is invasive and can be uncomfortable, inconvenient, and perceived as undesirable by patients. Furthermore, even experienced endoscopists may have difficulty reaching the cecum, resulting in incomplete visualizations of the colon. As a consequence, virtual colonoscopy (VC) has emerged as an alternative to OC. During VC, a virtual camera is used to view the internal walls of a virtual colon, reconstructed from CT scans of the abdominal cavity. However, current VC systems have had limited clinical appeal, as they are limited to specific types of polyps, may generate a large number of false positives, or have poor detection rates for significant polyps in the size range of 5-9 mm. The new technology we propose to commercialize through this SBIR work is a game changing, patented, visualization technique for VC, called the ""virtual fly-over"" technique. The technique is sensitive, effective, and efficient for detecting colon polyps. The overall objective of this proposal is to complete the development and validation of a novel visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy, which was patented by the University of Louisville. The hypothesis is that the new visualization technique will enable better viewing of the complex colonic topology, and hence a better capability to detect polyps, especially those that may be hidden behind haustral folds. The current prototype has been utilized to evaluate twenty clinical datasets, with excellent results. However, artifact removal and user friendly features must be incorporated prior to Phase II, in which the technology will be utilized in a larg scale clinical validation trial leading to a commercial product. Also, we propose to (1) generate more convincing preliminary data in a pilot study of 160 datasets, and (2) introduce several phantom polyps, in the size range of 5-9 mm, into the clinical datasets, in order to provide statistical significance of the technology's effectiveness. The phantom polyps will be placed in traditionally difficult-to-analyze positions, which pose significant detection problems for both OC and current VC methods. According to the literature, current OC methods result in a 61-91% (average 80%) viewing of the Colon. The University of Louisville's work in the ""fly-through VC method"", which mimics classic OC, results in 93.4 percent viewing, and the new ""fly-over"" method results in 97.5% percent viewing. Even more important is the improved point of view (""eye-in-the-sky""), the lack of optical distortion, and enhanced CAD functionality that will increase polyp recognition dramatically, especially when detecting small colon polyps, polyps hidden behind haustral folds, and polyps in folded colonic segments at anatomical inflection points. We anticipate the overall improvement in the ability to visualize difficult polyps to be upwards of 30% compared to today's methods, and we are excited about commercializing this technology with the University of Louisville.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US with only approximately 50% of the eligible population take advantage of current screening methods. The importance of this proposed technology is the early detection of colon cancer, in an acceptable manner that the general population will agree to, and without the associated morbidity of sedation that is required for the vast majority of endoscopic colonoscopy. We believe our technology has the potential to serve as a foundation for a huge step forward in automating and facilitating large scale screening of human colons, providing a more effective and much more acceptable method to the general population, than the currently invasive optical colonoscopy, which 50 % of the population still refuses to undergo.            ",Virtual Fly-Over Colonoscopy System for Clinical Test-SBIR Phase 1,8586142,R43CA179911,"['Abdominal Cavity', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Complex', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Flying body movement', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Helicopter', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Kentucky', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Medial', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Rivers', 'Science', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Sedation procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'experience', 'fly', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,"KENTUCKY IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2013,148821,0.04517635759209886
"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening. We have found several candidate regions that contain genetic risk factors in African Americans. These and other regions have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk by validated genetic associations. We will determine the functional genetic variants that increase risk by genetic and functional studies. These studies will have important implications for early detection and possibly therapeutic intervention among African Americans.          n/a",Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients,8545719,U01CA153060,"['15q23', '8q24', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'African American', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell model', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luciferases', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Targeted Resequencing', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'design', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro Assay', 'mortality', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2013,180004,0.13328881064337603
"Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies widely across the population. Statistical models have shown that there must be wide variation in the underlying 'familial risk profile' necessary to explain the well-established familial risks of CRC. On top of this, CRC risk is determined by personal characteristics and exposures to many environmental factors. Current screening guidelines use only age and rudimentary metrics of family history to stratify individuals to different regimens. To date, there are no CRC risk prediction models that integrate data on family history (including ages, ages at diagnoses, and relationships across multiple generations) and all known genetic factors, let alone environmental factors and personal characteristics associated with CRC risk. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model that will deliver an accurate individual risk prediction across the full spectrum of risk by using explicit family history data, as well as data on the presence or absence of all known genetic and environmental risk factors. This model will facilitate more appropriate screening recommendations to reduce the burden of disease. We will do this using data from a fully characterized, population-based study with comprehensively measured known and suspected risk factors including personal characteristics, environmental risk factors, complex family history, and measured genetic variants. We have at our disposal the Colon Cancer Family Registry, a large, prospective, international resource of families and individuals who span the continuum of risk for CRC, recruited from the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand since 1998. Participants have: (i) been tested for mutations in the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) and MUTYH, and measured for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with CRC; (ii) provided a multi-generational pedigree and family cancer history which has been validated where possible; and (iii) completed a risk factor questionnaire at baseline and every five years. We will accomplish our goal by addressing two aims. The first is to develop the CRC risk prediction model using measured genetic information, the multi-generational cancer family history data, and the information on all known risk factors. We will apply segregation analysis and logistic regression to data from 29,701 individuals from 12,902 population-based families. The second aim is to test the validity of the CRC risk prediction model and to determine its incremental value over existing models using prospective data. We will determine how well, in terms of calibration and predictive capacity, the model's predicted CRC risks (based on their baseline data) predict the CRC diagnoses occurring during the follow-up of the sub-cohort individuals with no history of CRC at baseline (19,390 with five-year follow-up of which 8,657 have 10-year follow-up). This comprehensive CRC risk prediction model will have many uses, including helping the development of targeted, population-wide screening strategies in which recommendations as to initiation age, frequency and modality, are tailored appropriately to predicted risks so as to increase the value and cost-effectiveness of screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop a comprehensive CRC risk prediction model that will accurately stratify individuals according to their levels of risk, basedon all known risk factors including genetic, environmental and personal characteristics. This model will aid the development of more appropriate screening recommendations and facilitate the application of mutation testing in a more effective manner. Our model is timely and offers the potential to change clinical practice and direct public health initiatives by moving resources to those people more likely to benefit from specific surveillance protocols or genetic tests.                ",Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction,8544444,R01CA170122,"['Address', 'Age', 'Australia', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family Characteristics', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MLH1 gene', 'MSH2 gene', 'MSH6 gene', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'New Zealand', 'PMS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer family registry', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'segregation']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,277734,0.12800475176176462
"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b  Background: Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, recency and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.   Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8460774,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'screening', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2013,343648,-0.003838961854471606
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNAs in a large set of population-based cases. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.

"Measurement of Inappropriate Screening Tests (MIST)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although routine screening can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, some screened patients may not be appropriate for screening. We define inappropriate screening as screening at intervals that are shorter than recommended by guidelines, screening high-risk patients with a method other than colonoscopy, and screening when the patient is unlikely to benefit because they are under age 50 over age 85 or of have a life expectancy of less than 5 years. Inappropriate CRC screening strains scarce gastroenterology resources, increases costs of healthcare, and exposes patients to inconvenience, stress and medical risks, including death. Little is known about the prevalence of inappropriate screening beyond single site estimates. Nor do we know about inter-facility variation or its causes. Both computerized clinical reminders (CCRs) which are used to prompt providers when a patient is due for screening, and CRC screening performance measure scores have been identified as important interventions to promote CRC screening. However, CCRs may contribute to over-screening if they do not facilitate critical evaluation of appropriateness, and performance measures may contribute to overuse by encouraging indiscriminate screening practices. Aims. The objective of this research is to improve the quality of CRC screening programs by minimizing the number of patients who receive inappropriate screening tests while maintaining high rates of appropriate CRC screening. This grant will quantify the extent of inappropriate screening in a large integrated health care system. It will also test hypotheses regarding the association of inappropriate CRC screening rates with facility CRC screening performance measure scores and CCR characteristics (i.e., whether the CCR contains input fields to document a rationale for not recommending screening). Approach. This one-year observational study will begin by identifying patients who had a CRC screening test at any Veterans Health Administration facility (n=139) in fiscal year 2010. An algorithm, developed for this study, will be applied to the administrative data to classify each screening procedure as inappropriate or appropriate based on patient demographics, screening history, and health status. To reduce error associated with automated classification, a manual chart review on a subsample of 10 patients from each of 32 facilities will be conducted. Predictive modeling and multiple imputation techniques will then be used to identify predictors of misclassification and to reclassify cases from the full sample that are identified as likely to have been initially misclassified. Facility estimates of inappropriate screening obtained from these analyses will then be entered as dependent variables into hierarchical logistic regression models to test proposed hypotheses regarding the relationships between facility CCR characteristics, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based performance measure scores, and inappropriate CRC screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will quantify the extent of inappropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within a large US healthcare system, examine relationships between inappropriate CRC screening and characteristics of facility CRC screening computerized clinical reminders, and test for an association between inappropriate screening and facility Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based CRC screening performance measure scores. Through this work we expect to identify improvements to current CRC screening strategies that will reduce the number of unnecessary procedures conducted on patients who are unlikely to benefit, while still facilitating CRC screening for those who are screening appropriate.              This project will quantify the extent of inappropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within a large US healthcare system, examine relationships between inappropriate CRC screening and characteristics of facility CRC screening computerized clinical reminders, and test for an association between inappropriate screening and facility Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)-based CRC screening performance measure scores.

"Mitochondria as a novel biomarker of colorectal adenoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although early detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, the precursors of most colorectal cancers, has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer, the disease remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We recently found that increased circulating concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers are associated with increased colorectal adenoma risk. Mitochondria (Mt) are the predominant source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a major cause of endogenous oxidative stress. Mitochondrial variations (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) have been associated with increased ROS production. Despite the central role for mitochondria in ROS production, their role in pathogenesis of colorectal adenomas has not been evaluated. We hypothesize that mtDNA copy number and germline variations in the mitochondrial genome will be associated with colorectal adenoma risk. We propose to evaluate this hypothesis by measuring mtDNA copy number using real time polymerase chain reaction and genotyping mitochondrial tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) and D-loop polymorphisms in 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls collected from three methodologically very similar, colonoscopy-based case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas.

This innovative epidemiologic study seeks to translate our understanding of mitochondrial biology into discovery of novel mitochondrial biomarkers that can inform strategies for the primary prevention of colorectal adenoma.

"Development of a comprehensive model for colorectal cancer risk prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies widely across the population. Statistical models have shown that there must be wide variation in the underlying 'familial risk profile' necessary to explain the well-established familial risks of CRC. On top of this, CRC risk is determined by personal characteristics and exposures to many environmental factors. Current screening guidelines use only age and rudimentary metrics of family history to stratify individuals to different regimens. To date, there are no CRC risk prediction models that integrate data on family history (including ages, ages at diagnoses, and relationships across multiple generations) and all known genetic factors, let alone environmental factors and personal characteristics associated with CRC risk. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model that will deliver an accurate individual risk prediction across the full spectrum of risk by using explicit family history data, as well as data on the presence or absence of all known genetic and environmental risk factors. This model will facilitate more appropriate screening recommendations to reduce the burden of disease. We will do this using data from a fully characterized, population-based study with comprehensively measured known and suspected risk factors including personal characteristics, environmental risk factors, complex family history, and measured genetic variants. We have at our disposal the Colon Cancer Family Registry, a large, prospective, international resource of families and individuals who span the continuum of risk for CRC, recruited from the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand since 1998. Participants have: (i) been tested for mutations in the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) and MUTYH, and measured for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with CRC; (ii) provided a multi-generational pedigree and family cancer history which has been validated where possible; and (iii) completed a risk factor questionnaire at baseline and every five years. We will accomplish our goal by addressing two aims. The first is to develop the CRC risk prediction model using measured genetic information, the multi-generational cancer family history data, and the information on all known risk factors. We will apply segregation analysis and logistic regression to data from 29,701 individuals from 12,902 population-based families. The second aim is to test the validity of the CRC risk prediction model and to determine its incremental value over existing models using prospective data. We will determine how well, in terms of calibration and predictive capacity, the model's predicted CRC risks (based on their baseline data) predict the CRC diagnoses occurring during the follow-up of the sub-cohort individuals with no history of CRC at baseline (19,390 with five-year follow-up of which 8,657 have 10-year follow-up). This comprehensive CRC risk prediction model will have many uses, including helping the development of targeted, population-wide screening strategies in which recommendations as to initiation age, frequency and modality, are tailored appropriately to predicted risks so as to increase the value and cost-effectiveness of screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop a comprehensive CRC risk prediction model that will accurately stratify individuals according to their levels of risk, basedon all known risk factors including genetic, environmental and personal characteristics. This model will aid the development of more appropriate screening recommendations and facilitate the application of mutation testing in a more effective manner. Our model is timely and offers the potential to change clinical practice and direct public health initiatives by moving resources to those people more likely to benefit from specific surveillance protocols or genetic tests.                  The proposed project will develop a comprehensive CRC risk prediction model that will accurately stratify individuals according to their levels of risk, basedon all known risk factors including genetic, environmental and personal characteristics.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b  Background: Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, recency and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.   Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8247668,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2012,279830,-0.003838961854471606
"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening. We have found several candidate regions that contain genetic risk factors in African Americans. These and other regions have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk by validated genetic associations. We will determine the functional genetic variants that increase risk by genetic and functional studies. These studies will have important implications for early detection and possibly therapeutic intervention among African Americans.          n/a",Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients,8307962,U01CA153060,"['15q23', '8q24', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'African American', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell model', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luciferases', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'design', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro Assay', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2012,344904,0.13328881064337603
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. n/a",Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans,8212393,R01CA132660,"['Adopted', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cognitive', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Community Participation', 'County', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Immigrant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Media Campaign', 'Media Intervention', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'community intervention', 'community organizations', 'comparison group', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'male', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medically underserved', 'medically underserved population', 'men', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'theories']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2012,540344,0.19876807390820284
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

"miRNA and colorectal cancer: associations with tumor phenotype and survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs. Our overall hypotheses are that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses. While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and to survival. We will analyze the expression of 866 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from: 1660 people with incident colon cancer; 840 people with incident rectal cancer; and 350 polyps from our colon and rectal cases who reported a prior polyp; 5% of tumors, will be analyzed for quality control. Our total assessment will be on 5475 samples. We will extend the validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype, inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival. Important miRNAs will be validated using TaqMan-based assays. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models. Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals. MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment and differential miRNAs that function as the ""driver"" vs. the ""passenger"" in the carcinogenic process. Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function. Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNAs in a large set of population-based cases. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 2500 CRC (colorectal cancer) and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNA expression and mutation in a large sample of population-based cases.

"Classification Tree Analysis to Enhance Targeting for Cancer Screening Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence of disparities in the utilization of cancer screening tests plays a central role in the nation's total set of efforts for cancer prevention and control. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are two key resources. Identifying groups in the population who are at risk of lower screening utilization typically starts with univariate analyses of associations between a set of potential covariates and utilization rates of a screening test, followed by multivariable analysis, most often using logistic regression, to determine the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. These statistically significant variables are then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce the observed disparities. Those interventions have the objective of providing resources necessary for improving access to, and utilization of, screening tests.  This proposed research is intended to examine the potential for Classification Analysis to inform the process of identifying at-risk groups for screening programs and services. Classification Analysis uses progressive segmentation of a dataset (i.e., recursive partitioning), to identify groups with higher versus lower rates on a dependent variable (e.g., cancer screening). Each of these groups is defined by a specific combination of characteristics. The Specific Aims of this two-year, secondary analysis R21 proposal are:  Aim 1.) To apply classification methods to the 2006 and 2008 BRFSS, and to the 2005 and 2008 NHIS, in order to identify groups in the population at risk of lower screening utilization based on multivariable classification. Screening domains will be for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer.  Aim 2.) To examine the results obtained across classification methods, in order to better understand how best to capitalize on the potential of using classification methods to identify groups in the population at-risk of low cancer screening.  Aim 3.) To use classification methods to investigate whether content from BRFSS state-optional modules can supplement information from the core BRFSS to identify groups likely to have low utilization and complex service needs.  Multivariable classification of at-risk groups, informed by CTA methods, could enhance the targeting of audiences for the important pre-intervention tasks of needs assessment, barrier/facilitator identification, and marshalling the resources needed to improve the screening status of those groups.               PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests.

"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening. We have found several candidate regions that contain genetic risk factors in African Americans. These and other regions have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk by validated genetic associations. We will determine the functional genetic variants that increase risk by genetic and functional studies. These studies will have important implications for early detection and possibly therapeutic intervention among African Americans.          n/a",Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients,8125133,U01CA153060,"['15q23', '8q24', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'African American', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell model', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luciferases', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'design', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro Assay', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2011,351801,0.13328881064337603
"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.               Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8066377,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2011,367538,-0.00367325853369201
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer.           n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8178935,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'design', 'exome', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,537462,0.1714463349906324
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. n/a",Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans,8020030,R01CA132660,"['Adopted', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cognitive', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Community Participation', 'County', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Immigrant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Media Campaign', 'Media Intervention', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'community intervention', 'community organizations', 'comparison group', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'male', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medically underserved', 'medically underserved population', 'men', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'theories']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2011,542634,0.19876807390820284
"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms.

"Classification Tree Analysis to Enhance Targeting for Cancer Screening Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence of disparities in the utilization of cancer screening tests plays a central role in the nation's total set of efforts for cancer prevention and control. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are two key resources. Identifying groups in the population who are at risk of lower screening utilization typically starts with univariate analyses of associations between a set of potential covariates and utilization rates of a screening test, followed by multivariable analysis, most often using logistic regression, to determine the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. These statistically significant variables are then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce the observed disparities. Those interventions have the objective of providing resources necessary for improving access to, and utilization of, screening tests.  This proposed research is intended to examine the potential for Classification Analysis to inform the process of identifying at-risk groups for screening programs and services. Classification Analysis uses progressive segmentation of a dataset (i.e., recursive partitioning), to identify groups with higher versus lower rates on a dependent variable (e.g., cancer screening).

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.               Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,7938955,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2010,371250,-0.00367325853369201
"Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious public health problem that affects African Americans (AA) disproportionately. Both incidence rates and morbidity and mortality is higher in AAs than in other Americans. Family history, that is, genetic risk, remains one of the most important factors in recommendations for screening. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 10 independent regions harboring genetic risk factors in CRC in populations of European ancestry. Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these studies, we have obtained evidence of association in four of these regions in AA CRC. Our goal is to identify the functional genetic risk factors, quantify their effects, and determine their functions. To pursue this goal, we propose four Aims. (1) We will validate previously identified candidate CRC-associated regions in AA CRC cases and controls. We will use Sequenom genotyping and tag SNPs from these regions to identify SNPs associated with CRC in AAs. We will use 100 ancestry informative markers to perform a structured logistic regression analysis that takes into account possible population stratification based on ancestry. Because AAs are more diverse than European Americans, these studies will very likely lead to better localization of the genetic risk factors. (2) We will use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to conduct a resequencing analysis of each candidate genetic region in 96 (48 CRC and 48 controls) persons with CRC. The region that we resequence will be guided by the genes and linkage disequilibrium observed in each CRC-associated region. (3) We will better quantify the effects of the genetic risk factors in each region. We will perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify putative functional variants. These functional candidates along with our novel genetic variants in CRC-associated regions will be genotyped in up to 2000 AA cases and 2000 AA control. We will perform structured logistic regression analysis to obtain the strongest genotype relative risks in each CRC-associated regions. (4) The foregoing analyses will provide a short-list of candidate genetic risk factors for each CRC-associated region. We will begin to characterize the molecular basis of CRC risk for each region by functional assays designed based on the putative mechanism caused by the genetic variants (regulatory or enzymatic). Molecular assays (for example, luciferase reporter assays) will be designed to determine the functional impact of candidate genetic risk factors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer affects African Americans disproportionately relative to other Americans. The discovery of genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer predisposition is tantamount to a fundamental understanding of the etiology of this significant health problem and to recommendations for cancer screening. We have found several candidate regions that contain genetic risk factors in African Americans. These and other regions have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk by validated genetic associations. We will determine the functional genetic variants that increase risk by genetic and functional studies. These studies will have important implications for early detection and possibly therapeutic intervention among African Americans.          n/a",Genetic risk factors in African American colorectal cancer patients,7993187,U01CA153060,"['15q23', '8q24', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'African American', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell model', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luciferases', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'design', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vitro Assay', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2010,376931,0.13328881064337603
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians,7825479,R01CA115983,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Excision', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'group intervention', 'health belief', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'intervention effect', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'therapy design', 'uptake']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2010,389993,0.18166656531491474
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. Public Health Relevance: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States  to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.",Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans,7766896,R01CA132660,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birds', 'Breast', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cognitive', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Community Participation', 'County', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Immigrant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Media Campaign', 'Media Intervention', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'community intervention', 'community organizations', 'comparison group', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'male', 'medically underserved', 'medically underserved population', 'men', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'theories']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2010,577046,0.21551415113308178
"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed. It will provide efficient computational tools for earlier cancer detection, prevention, and risk assessment.           Public Health Relevant Statement This research will provide computational tools and software for early cancer detection and intervention.

"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of non-adherence to any CRC screening strategy.

"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7663183,R01CA106773,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Caring', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Survey', 'Development', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'health belief', 'mortality', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prospective', 'secondary outcome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,153810,0.16569736193429493
"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms. Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests sufficiently reliable to apply to clinical practice in the detection of colon cancer. The focus of this work is to utilized new technology develop in our laboratory to define a non-invasive blood test applicable to early detection, diagnosis and/or screening of patients and permit preventive strategies, differential treatment and/or therapeutic targeting.",Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection,7586435,R21CA132723,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Comorbidity', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family history of', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Printing', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'new technology', 'racial and ethnic', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,211859,0.10890762700068121
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.

"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7917756,R01CA106773,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Caring', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Survey', 'Development', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'health belief', 'mortality', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prospective', 'secondary outcome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,321562,0.16569736193429493
"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.               Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities.

"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans,7617157,R01CA115983,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Excision', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'group intervention', 'health belief', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'intervention effect', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'therapy design', 'uptake']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2009,448552,0.18039256792248753

"Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the US. Determining who is at higher risk is especially important in CRC because screening tests are available that are proven to reduce death. Risk of CRC development is due to both hereditary and environmental factors which are not uniformly shared between all populations. To date, the field of CRC genetics has focused largely on Caucasian populations, while few studies have included African-American (AA) patients. Determining risk factors in AAs is an especially important goal because both incidence and mortality in this population are not decreasing as they are in all other US populations. At the University of Chicago, we are uniquely equipped to address genetic factors in AAs because we have assembled a large AA CRC case-control series. The main purpose of this study is to identify CRC-susceptibility alleles using a candidate gene screen approach and test for association in AA CRC patients and controls. CRC is particularly amenable to candidate gene studies because biologically relevant pathways have been identified in hereditary CRC syndromes and in the analysis of carcinogenesis in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. The base excision repair pathway is especially interesting because recent work has elucidated a recessive polyposis syndrome associated with mutations in the gene MYH. Thus, genes involved in this pathway are biologically plausible candidates for harboring CRC-susceptibility alleles, but they have not been adequately identified or characterized in AAs to date. Our hypothesis is that novel susceptibility alleles in base-excision repair genes contribute to risk of CRC development in African-Americans. To test this hypothesis, we will screen candidate base-excision repair genes using high throughput heteroduplex analysis and use sequencing to characterize DNA changes (Specific Aim 1). To control for population stratification in our admixed AA population, we will determine individual ancestry estimates using a set of high informative ancestry informative markers (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will genotype our putative CRC-susceptibility alleles identified in our candidate gene screens in a series of 400 AA CRC cases and 400 controls and then test for association by logistic regression (Specific Aim 3). With improved understanding of individual risk and proper screening, colorectal cancer is largely a preventable disease. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk especially in African-Americans who have the highest incidence and death from this cancer.           n/a",Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients,7531036,F32CA132493,"['Address', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Carcinoma', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'cancer genetics', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'gene repair', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'polyposis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2008,12818,0.17801751164779436
"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7340158,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,121564,0.223047678226812
"Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite their potential to reduce cancer burden through early detection, the effectiveness of screening programs is often undermined by systems-based factors and human factors. The broad aims of this application are to develop and evaluate a computer-based technology called TRACS to monitor the process of cancer screening in individual patients and intervene as necessary to ensure that the screening is conducted reliably and effectively. Interventions in TRACS consist of reliable notifications to clinicians and/or patients. However, unlike many other reminder systems, TRACS continues to monitor the care of the patient subsequent to the notification.       In this phase of the application, TRACS will be used to address the reliability of follow up of abnormal or equivocal results from screening mammography for breast cancer. A knowledge module will be created in TRACS knowledge base for the monitoring of the follow up of abnormal screening mammograms. A knowledge module comprises the process definition that specifies the appropriate course of actions for a clinical scenario and logical rules for making decisions within the process. In the next phase, additional knowledge modules will be included for comprehensive support for screening of breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colon cancer.       An important feature of TRACS will be the ability to extract information from clinical text documents using a natural language processing engine called HITex. Reports of several cancer screening tests, such as mammography, cervical smear, and colonoscopy, are in the form of text documents. Thus it is important to be able to extract relevant information from these documents for use by TRACS. HITex will be customized to extract the recommendations of the radiologist from screening mammogram reports. Specifically, it will extract whether the radiologist recommends a non-routine follow up. If that is the case, HITex will extract the recommended follow up (e.g., diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, or needle biopsy).       TRACS will be deployed and evaluated at the New England Medical Center (NEMC), a large urban medical center in Boston. The first step in the evaluation will be to confirm that information from screening mammogram reports from NEMC can be extracted accurately by HITex. During this phase, the TRACS software and the abnormal mammography follow up knowledge module will be tested in a simulated setting at NEMC. The tests will be conducted using records of patients who had previously undergone screening mammography at NEMC. The behavior of TRACS for these cases will be rated by a panel of experts from NEMC. In the next phase, TRACS will be deployed operationally at NEMC. Project Narrative The software proposed to being developed under this project aims to improve the early identification of a number of commonly occurring cancers. It will do so by following up reliably on the management of those patients that have abnormal results in cancer screening tests.          n/a",Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System,7481710,R43CA134042,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Boston', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Closure', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Mammography', 'Medical center', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Puncture biopsy', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Schedule', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Simulate', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'computer generated', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool']",NCI,U.S. CARELINK,R43,2008,122518,-0.010702114821679303
"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of non-adherence to any CRC screening strategy.  The project culminates in development and submission of an R-01 grant for development and testing of tailored messages directed at barriers identified in aim 2 and the development, testing and evaluation of a tailored education intervention to be delivered in a ""teachable moment"".             n/a",Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening,7425095,K07CA108664,"['Adherence', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Appointment', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Incidence', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistics', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Prospective Studies', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'cancer education', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'disease natural history', 'evaluation/testing', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'point of care', 'psychosocial', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K07,2008,136080,0.14998800176594718
"Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for disparities in the utilization of screening tests plays a central role in the nation's efforts at cancer prevention and control. Persons in traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups have had lower screening rates relative to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition, they often have disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality. The process of making decisions about groups in the population who are ""at-risk"" of lower screening test utilization typically starts with bivariate analyses of the associations between a set of potential covariates and use of a screening test. The next step is to conduct multivariable analysis most often using logistic regression, to identify the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. This final set of statistically significant variables is then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce disparities. This proposed research addresses a situation we, and others, have observed in several analyses of cancer screening in population-based data sets. That is, analyses done with different survey databases have found several instances where bivariate associations between race/ethnicity and cancer screening have been ""reversed"" in multivariable analyses. That is, a group with lower screening in bivariate (""crude rate"") analysis shows higher screening based on the ""adjusted"" results from the multivariable analysis. These reversals may have implications not only for intervention planning, but also for the way that analyses are conducted to identify correlates of a screening procedure. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: 1.) To investigate the extent of reversals of associations from bivariate to multivariable analyses of the correlates of cancer screening, by examining results several population-level surveys, by using multiple years of each survey, and by expanding the scope of screening tests to include both women and men. 2.) To investigate variables that may explain reversals of association when comparing the results of bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with cancer screening tests. This two-year project will conduct secondary analyses with multiple years of data from three national- level surveys: The National Health Interview Survey, The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health Information National Trends Survey. Five screening tests will be examined: mammography, clinical breast exam, Pap testing, prostate exam, and colorectal examination. This research will extend research to date in several ways. First, it greatly expands the number of survey databases being examined. Second, it expands the number of screening tests being reviewed, and gives added attention to male screening. Third, it uses definitions of screening that are as consistent as possible across the individual surveys. Fourth, it uses a consistent set of independent variables across the surveys. Fifth, it will be possible to look for trends over time in the presence of reversals of association for repeat screening.           n/a",Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests,7404442,R21CA127828,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Disease regression', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Factor Analysis', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistically Significant', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'racial and ethnic', 'trend']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,191838,0.060019020684983965
"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7495506,R01CA106773,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Caring', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Survey', 'Development', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Models', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'health belief', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'prospective']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,271278,0.16569736193429493
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans,7409537,R01CA115983,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Counseling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Excision', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Provider', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'health belief', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'therapy design', 'uptake']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2008,499736,0.18039256792248753
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.

"Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the US. Determining who is at higher risk is especially important in CRC because screening tests are available that are proven to reduce death. Risk of CRC development is due to both hereditary and environmental factors which are not uniformly shared between all populations. To date, the field of CRC genetics has focused largely on Caucasian populations, while few studies have included African-American (AA) patients. Determining risk factors in AAs is an especially important goal because both incidence and mortality in this population are not decreasing as they are in all other US populations. At the University of Chicago, we are uniquely equipped to address genetic factors in AAs because we have assembled a large AA CRC case-control series. The main purpose of this study is to identify CRC-susceptibility alleles using a candidate gene screen approach and test for association in AA CRC patients and controls. CRC is particularly amenable to candidate gene studies because biologically relevant pathways have been identified in hereditary CRC syndromes and in the analysis of carcinogenesis in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. The base excision repair pathway is especially interesting because recent work has elucidated a recessive polyposis syndrome associated with mutations in the gene MYH. Thus, genes involved in this pathway are biologically plausible candidates for harboring CRC-susceptibility alleles, but they have not been adequately identified or characterized in AAs to date. Our hypothesis is that novel susceptibility alleles in base-excision repair genes contribute to risk of CRC development in African-Americans. To test this hypothesis, we will screen candidate base-excision repair genes using high throughput heteroduplex analysis and use sequencing to characterize DNA changes (Specific Aim 1). To control for population stratification in our admixed AA population, we will determine individual ancestry estimates using a set of high informative ancestry informative markers (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will genotype our putative CRC-susceptibility alleles identified in our candidate gene screens in a series of 400 AA CRC cases and 400 controls and then test for association by logistic regression (Specific Aim 3). With improved understanding of individual risk and proper screening, colorectal cancer is largely a preventable disease. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk especially in African-Americans who have the highest incidence and death from this cancer.           n/a",Genetic Association Study in African-American Colorectal Cancer Patients,7409260,F32CA132493,"['Address', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Carcinoma', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'cancer genetics', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'gene repair', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'polyposis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2007,56702,0.17801751164779436
"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7212022,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,R21,2007,122600,0.223047678226812
"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening.

"Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for disparities in the utilization of screening tests plays a central role in the nation's efforts at cancer prevention and control. Persons in traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups have had lower screening rates relative to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition, they often have disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality. The process of making decisions about groups in the population who are ""at-risk"" of lower screening test utilization typically starts with bivariate analyses of the associations between a set of potential covariates and use of a screening test. The next step is to conduct multivariable analysis most often using logistic regression, to identify the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. This final set of statistically significant variables is then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce disparities. This proposed research addresses a situation we, and others, have observed in several analyses of cancer screening in population-based data sets. That is, analyses done with different survey databases have found several instances where bivariate associations between race/ethnicity and cancer screening have been ""reversed"" in multivariable analyses. That is, a group with lower screening in bivariate (""crude rate"") analysis shows higher screening based on the ""adjusted"" results from the multivariable analysis. These reversals may have implications not only for intervention planning, but also for the way that analyses are conducted to identify correlates of a screening procedure. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: 1.) To investigate the extent of reversals of associations from bivariate to multivariable analyses of the correlates of cancer screening, by examining results several population-level surveys, by using multiple years of each survey, and by expanding the scope of screening tests to include both women and men. 2.) To investigate variables that may explain reversals of association when comparing the results of bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with cancer screening tests. This two-year project will conduct secondary analyses with multiple years of data from three national- level surveys: The National Health Interview Survey, The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health Information National Trends Survey. Five screening tests will be examined: mammography, clinical breast exam, Pap testing, prostate exam, and colorectal examination. This research will extend research to date in several ways. First, it greatly expands the number of survey databases being examined. Second, it expands the number of screening tests being reviewed, and gives added attention to male screening. Third, it uses definitions of screening that are as consistent as possible across the individual surveys. Fourth, it uses a consistent set of independent variables across the surveys. Fifth, it will be possible to look for trends over time in the presence of reversals of association for repeat screening.           n/a",Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests,7238472,R21CA127828,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Disease regression', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Factor Analysis', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistically Significant', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'racial and ethnic', 'trend']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,168472,0.060019020684983965
"Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objectives: In environments with limited economic resources, it is paramount that the cost-effectiveness of competing strategies of management be compared. Our previous work illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of screening to decrease mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) depends heavily on adherence, and specifically on whether adherence between screening strategies is heterogeneous. The objectives of this study are to: 1. Determine whether there exists heterogeneity in adherence between different CRC screening tests, 2. Utilize prospective rates of adherence to calculate the true incremental cost-effectiveness between competing CRC screening strategies, 3. Identify factors associated with non-adherence to screening. Research Design: Prospective cohort study in which subjects' adherence to CRC screening tests scheduled by their primary care provider (PCP) is measured. Strategies to be evaluated include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy (VC, when approved for CRC screening). A study survey based on constructs of the Health Belief Model will be administered. Population to be Studied: Patients at average risk for development of CRC. Principal Source of Data: The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening, defined as completion of the screening strategy scheduled for the subject within 12-months of enrollment, verified through computerized medical records and subject contact. Secondary outcomes include assessment of preventive intention, measured by subject scheduling of CRC tests, calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness between competing strategies of CRC screening, and identification of survey and demographic items associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7277322,R01CA106773,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Caring', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Survey', 'Development', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Models', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'health belief', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'prospective']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2007,325358,0.16569736193429493
"Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular screening reduces both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening rates, however, remain low suggesting the need for innovative research designed to increase screening behavior. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions (Tailored Health Communications [THC] and Motivational Interviewing [MI]) in increasing CRC screening behavior. Both interventions are based on a strong conceptual framework derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Transtheoretical Model (TTM), allowing us to explore the underlying mechanisms through which these interventions impact behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to compare CRC screening test use among 804 participants randomly allocated to control or intervention conditions; 402 participants will be recruited from each site (Salt Lake City, UT and Nashville, TN). The three study groups will receive (1) standard care, (2) tailored health communication, and (3) motivational interviewing. Eligibility criteria for study participants includes being 50 years or older, not having CRC, and being of average or moderate risk for CRC. Study participants will be surveyed by telephone about CRC related beliefs pre-intervention (Time 1), one month post intervention (Time 2), and at 6 and 12 months (Times 3 and 4 respectively). Salt Like City participants will be primarily Caucasian and those from Nashville will be African American. Dichotomous behavioral outcomes (had screening test or not) and stages of CRC screening test adoption (based on the TTM) will be assessed, as well as sociodemographic and belief predictors of screening behavior. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression models will be used to evaluate screening test use and stage of test adoption. Sociodemographic and belief variables will be used as covariates, with intervention groups at the primary independent predictor. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA will be employed to assess between intervention differences in amenable beliefs. Path (mediation) analysis will be performed to further explore the underlying mechanisms through which THC and MI may differentially affect CRC screening behavior.         n/a",Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings,7222783,R01NR008425,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Condition', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nature', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Purpose', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compare effectiveness', 'health belief', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'statistics', 'therapy design']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,R01,2007,415821,0.18433006721431522
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians,7234394,R01CA115983,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Counseling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Excision', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Provider', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'health belief', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'therapy design', 'uptake']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2007,477195,0.18166656531491474
"Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Survival is strongly determined by stage at the time of diagnosis but only approximately 40% of all new cases are diagnosed at local stage. Effective screening methods are available which can lead to early detection and reduced mortality from this disease, but these remain underutilized. We believe the factors that influence colorectal cancer screening rates in a population determine the stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in that population. We propose to conduct a population based case: control study to identify factors associated with stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in a high-risk, underserved population. In particular, we will study the relationship between physician characteristics, type of practice, specialty training, knowledge of screening guidelines, attitudes regarding screening, actual screening practices, approaches to patient education and communication, and perceived barriers to screening in relation to stage at colorectal cancer diagnosis. The study will compare approximately 533 patients with incident local stage invasive colorectal cancer (cases) and 1242 patients with more advanced stage disease (controls) identified from a population-based cancer registry. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between cancer stage and physician characteristics and behaviors while controlling for confounding. This research will increase the knowledge base regarding screening practices of community-based physicians and how these practices affect stage at diagnosis and ultimately colorectal cancer outcome. A better understanding of the utilization of currently available screening procedures and attitudes toward screening will help illuminate the reasons for the low prevalence of colorectal screening and high colorectal mortality observed in the United States. Public Health Relevance: Underutilization of colorectal cancer screening contributes to delays in detection causing patients to be diagnosed with larger (more advanced stage) tumors. We will conduct a study examining the relation between physician factors (training, beliefs about screening, screening practices) and stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer. These characteristics can be used to identify practitioners likely to benefit from educational efforts designed to increase colorectal cancer screening.         n/a",Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage,7128538,R03CA113107,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'early diagnosis', 'health care personnel performance', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'mass screening', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient oriented research']",NCI,NORTHEAST REGIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,R03,2006,46328,0.13956681690376538
"Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in the VA Populatio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background:Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of Cancer death in the United States. In spite of demonstrated efficacy and guideline recommendations, colorectal cancer screening rates are low.  Purpose: This study is the next step in development and validation of new instrument, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior Questionnaire (CRCSBQ) to measure colorectal cancer screening participation. The long- term goal of this study is to contribute to the development of a resource of cancer screening measures with known validity across multiple settings and populations.  Methods: Phase 1: The CRCSBQ will undergo cognitive testing in a sample of patients (32 total) at two geographically diverse Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. Patients will be from the primary care clinics, over age 50 and include Caucasians and African-Americans of both genders. Phase 2: The CRCSBQ and a demographics questionnaire will be administered to 200 (total) primary care patients at the 2 sites. In addition, medical record data will abstracted from the VA electronic medical record, non-VA medical records and Medicare claims data (patients older than 65). The questionnaire responses will be compared to the medical record data. We will calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the concordance, relative sensitivity, specificity and report-to-records ratio of the CRCSBQ to detect current colorectal cancer screening status by the American Cancer Society guidelines compared to the medical record review. We will use logistic regression analysis to explore patient factors that may be associated with agreement between self-report and medical records for colorectal cancer screening.  Importance: Accurate measurement of colorectal cancer screening behavior is the essential first step in studying the problem of low screening rates. Veterans followed at VA primary care clinics represent the ideal population in which to validate the new instrument. The VA health care system is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. There is a comprehensive electronic record which includes all inpatient and outpatient care at any VA medical center. The VA population is diverse and includes representation from a range of age groups, racial and ethnic minorities and a substantial proportion of individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and lower educational levels. n/a",Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in the VA Populatio,7007710,R21CA102379,"['behavior prediction', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'health behavior', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'mass screening', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'psychometrics', 'questionnaires', 'veterans']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,126389,0.13734162159353164

"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening. n/a",Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial,7061307,R01CA100856,"['Asian Americans', 'Internet', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'continuing education', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'health disparity', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'longitudinal human study', 'mass screening', 'medical education', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'radio', 'television', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2006,322534,0.1460534091936561

Principal Types of Analysis: Specific objective 1 will compare adherence to FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, and VC. Specific objective 2 will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between competing CRC screening strategies incorporating the prospectively derived adherence rates. Specific objective 3 will examine the association between potential predictive factors identified from the study survey and non-adherence to CRC screening. Analytic methods will include Chi-square testing of proportions, linear mixed-effects modeling and logistic regression analysis. PCPs will be examined as random- and fixed-effects in separate models to account for potential clustering of outcomes within PCP practices. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use our published decision analytic models. Public Health: This study will compare adherence to competing screening tests in order to identify the most cost-effectiveness strategy to decrease mortality from CRC. Barriers to screening identified through this study will form the basis of future novel programs to increase CRC screening adherence.             n/a",Adherence and the Economics of Colon Cancer Screening,7033273,R01CA106773,"['belief', 'clinical research', 'colon neoplasms', 'cost effectiveness', 'endoscopy', 'gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', 'health', 'model']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2006,348147,0.16569736193429493
"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,7030281,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2006,404298,0.06265914669688735
"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.              n/a",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians,7089697,R01CA115983,"['African American', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'blood tests', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'colon neoplasms', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'education evaluation /planning', 'endoscopy', 'focus groups', 'gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', 'handbook', 'health behavior', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'interview', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'racial /ethnic difference']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2006,451935,0.18139330764462447
"Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular screening reduces both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening rates, however, remain low suggesting the need for innovative research designed to increase screening behavior. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions (Tailored Health Communications [THC] and Motivational Interviewing [MI]) in increasing CRC screening behavior. Both interventions are based on a strong conceptual framework derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Transtheoretical Model (TTM), allowing us to explore the underlying mechanisms through which these interventions impact behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to compare CRC screening test use among 804 participants randomly allocated to control or intervention conditions; 402 participants will be recruited from each site (Salt Lake City, UT and Nashville, TN). The three study groups will receive (1) standard care, (2) tailored health communication, and (3) motivational interviewing. Eligibility criteria for study participants includes being 50 years or older, not having CRC, and being of average or moderate risk for CRC. Study participants will be surveyed by telephone about CRC related beliefs pre-intervention (Time 1), one month post intervention (Time 2), and at 6 and 12 months (Times 3 and 4 respectively). Salt Like City participants will be primarily Caucasian and those from Nashville will be African American. Dichotomous behavioral outcomes (had screening test or not) and stages of CRC screening test adoption (based on the TTM) will be assessed, as well as sociodemographic and belief predictors of screening behavior. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression models will be used to evaluate screening test use and stage of test adoption. Sociodemographic and belief variables will be used as covariates, with intervention groups at the primary independent predictor. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA will be employed to assess between intervention differences in amenable beliefs. Path (mediation) analysis will be performed to further explore the underlying mechanisms through which THC and MI may differentially affect CRC screening behavior.         n/a",Increasing CRC Screening in Primary Care Settings,7026013,R01NR008425,"['African American', 'behavior modification', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'belief', 'cancer risk', 'caucasian American', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'early diagnosis', 'health behavior', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'interview', 'longitudinal human study', 'motivation', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care management', 'racial /ethnic difference']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2006,510643,0.18433006721431522
"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors. Specially, we hypothesize that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR interact with dietary such as calcium, vitamin D, sugar, and glycemic index; sunshine exposure, physical activity, aspirin use, and body size to alter risk of colorectal cancer; that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with specific types of mutations in tumors including microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with survival after diagnosis.  To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.  This study builds on a unique existing resource to study genetic and environmental associations with colorectal cancer.

"Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Survival is strongly determined by stage at the time of diagnosis but only approximately 40% of all new cases are diagnosed at local stage. Effective screening methods are available which can lead to early detection and reduced mortality from this disease, but these remain underutilized. We believe the factors that influence colorectal cancer screening rates in a population determine the stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in that population. We propose to conduct a population based case: control study to identify factors associated with stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in a high-risk, underserved population. In particular, we will study the relationship between physician characteristics, type of practice, specialty training, knowledge of screening guidelines, attitudes regarding screening, actual screening practices, approaches to patient education and communication, and perceived barriers to screening in relation to stage at colorectal cancer diagnosis. The study will compare approximately 533 patients with incident local stage invasive colorectal cancer (cases) and 1242 patients with more advanced stage disease (controls) identified from a population-based cancer registry. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between cancer stage and physician characteristics and behaviors while controlling for confounding. This research will increase the knowledge base regarding screening practices of community-based physicians and how these practices affect stage at diagnosis and ultimately colorectal cancer outcome. A better understanding of the utilization of currently available screening procedures and attitudes toward screening will help illuminate the reasons for the low prevalence of colorectal screening and high colorectal mortality observed in the United States. Public Health Relevance: Underutilization of colorectal cancer screening contributes to delays in detection causing patients to be diagnosed with larger (more advanced stage) tumors. We will conduct a study examining the relation between physician factors (training, beliefs about screening, screening practices) and stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer. These characteristics can be used to identify practitioners likely to benefit from educational efforts designed to increase colorectal cancer screening.         n/a",Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage,7058928,R03CA113107,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'early diagnosis', 'health care personnel performance', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human subject', 'mass screening', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient oriented research']",NCI,NORTHEAST REGIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,R03,2005,52497,0.13956681690376538
"Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Assessing whether items are biased against minority groups is very important for the validity of measurement scales in cancer control and in health sciences in general. Although we have scales to measure beliefs (based on the Health Belief Model) that are predictive of cancer screening behavior, we do not know the extent of cultural bias. Thus, we are missing a critical component in the assessment of psychometric validity. The statistical techniques for detecting item bias are called procedures for detecting differential item functioning (DIF). Under certain conditions, two of the most commonly-used DIF procedures, logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel, can inaccurately display inflated Type I error. The primary purpose of the present methodological proposal is to improve power and Type I error of both the logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel procedures by using alternative matching scores other than traditional summed-item score. Using existing data from two large NIH-funded randomized intervention trials to increase mammography screening (ideal because of equal percentages of Caucasians and African-Americans), we will address these aims: (1) Using computer simulations based on the data structure for generalizing results to breast cancer screening belief scales, we will evaluate the extent to which innovative modifications of logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures control Type I error inflation and improve power, and (2) Using the best modified logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures (derived from Aim 1), assess items for DIF in the two existing data sets based upon ethnicity, age, education and income in six scales commonly used to predict cancer screening (barriers, benefits, susceptibility, fatalism, self-efficacy, and fear). Improved accuracy of DIF procedures will increase the validity of cancer control scales, providing a firm measurement foundation for advancing the science of cancer control and prevention. Additionally, the findings will have broad applicability to detecting item bias in other scales. n/a",Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales,6953171,R03CA113099,"['analytical method', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'belief', 'bias', 'cancer prevention', 'computer simulation', 'health behavior', 'health disparity', 'human data', 'mammography', 'mass screening', 'method development', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R03,2005,59961,0.0071481285051684575
"Interactive CRC Screening Education in Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Regular screening reduces both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening rates, however, remain low suggesting the need for innovative research designed to increase screening behavior. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of an interactive, computer-assisted cancer screening kiosk (CACSK).

"Mammography Visits to Improve Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall goal: to explore behavioral correlations between colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and screening mammography and develop an innovative approach for reducing barriers to CRC screening in women, using screening mammography, an existing non-colon cancer related screening test that has widespread public acceptance, as a ""teachable moment (TM).""  This study will be the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention designed to increase CRC screening administered at a cancer screening visit unrelated to CRC. Specific alms: 1) To evaluate screening mammography as a setting (or ""teachable moment"") for administering CRC education; 2) To identify psychosocial barriers to colorectal cancer screening in women undergoing screening mammography; Aim 1 includes two separate randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effect of a CRC educational video on CRC screening adherence in women (aims 1A/1B) and an observational study evaluating screening mammography as a TM.  Aim 1A tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a screening mammography appointment.  Aim 1B tests the efficacy of the CRC educational video intervention when administered during a general medicine clinic visit.  Aim 1C tests the moderator effect of screening mammography on the effect of the educational intervention on CRC adherence using a quasi-experimental design by comparing the group receiving the CRC education intervention during screening mammography and the group who receive the same intervention during a noncancer screening-related clinic visit.  The primary outcome for aim 1 is the proportion of women due for CRC screening who complete screening within 6 months of the intervention.  Aim 2 uses survey methods to identify psychosocial barriers to CRC screening, based on the integrated TM-preventive health model.  A questionnaire will be prospectively administered to the participants prior to and immediately after the educational intervention.  Baseline information elicited from the study questionnaire and demographic characteristics will be used as independent variables in a series of multivariable analyses to assess the impact of each predictor on the non-adherence to CRC screening.  Predictor variables achieving statistical significance in the bivariate analyses (p<0.05) of non-adherence status and each of the potential predictor variables will be entered into a logistic model to determine independent variables associated with non-adherence to CRC screening. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis will be used to determine factors predictive of non-adherence to any CRC screening strategy.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in VA Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background:Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of Cancer death in the United States. In spite of demonstrated efficacy and guideline recommendations, colorectal cancer screening rates are low.  Purpose: This study is the next step in development and validation of new instrument, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior Questionnaire (CRCSBQ) to measure colorectal cancer screening participation. The long- term goal of this study is to contribute to the development of a resource of cancer screening measures with known validity across multiple settings and populations.  Methods: Phase 1: The CRCSBQ will undergo cognitive testing in a sample of patients (32 total) at two geographically diverse Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. Patients will be from the primary care clinics, over age 50 and include Caucasians and African-Americans of both genders. Phase 2: The CRCSBQ and a demographics questionnaire will be administered to 200 (total) primary care patients at the 2 sites. In addition, medical record data will abstracted from the VA electronic medical record, non-VA medical records and Medicare claims data (patients older than 65). The questionnaire responses will be compared to the medical record data. We will calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the concordance, relative sensitivity, specificity and report-to-records ratio of the CRCSBQ to detect current colorectal cancer screening status by the American Cancer Society guidelines compared to the medical record review. We will use logistic regression analysis to explore patient factors that may be associated with agreement between self-report and medical records for colorectal cancer screening.  Importance: Accurate measurement of colorectal cancer screening behavior is the essential first step in studying the problem of low screening rates. Veterans followed at VA primary care clinics represent the ideal population in which to validate the new instrument. The VA health care system is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. There is a comprehensive electronic record which includes all inpatient and outpatient care at any VA medical center. The VA population is diverse and includes representation from a range of age groups, racial and ethnic minorities and a substantial proportion of individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and lower educational levels. n/a",Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in VA Population,6863573,R21CA102379,"['behavior prediction', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'health behavior', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'mass screening', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'psychometrics', 'questionnaires', 'veterans']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,165120,0.13750669496322399
"Prospective study on viral load of cervical cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to bring about prevention of cervix cancer through improved biologic understanding and more cost-effective screening strategies. Although human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer, it is incompletely known if viral load of HPV influences progression from cancer in situ (CIS) to invasive cancer and/or interacts with genetic factors. Since clinical intervention precludes direct observation of this progression. unconventional approaches are needed. Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested design in this large study base with up to 25 years of complete follow-up, we will identify 600 women with invasive cancer, 600 women with CIS and 600 individually matched control women to each case-group. Using validated and sensitive PCR assays, the presence of viral DNA - and for HPV 16, also the viral load -will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on average four per individual, giving a total of about 9600 smears).

"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,6883181,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,400229,0.06265914669688735
"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening. n/a",Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial,6887830,R01CA100856,"['Asian Americans', 'Internet', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'continuing education', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'health disparity', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'longitudinal human study', 'mass screening', 'medical education', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'radio', 'television', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2005,437729,0.1460534091936561

"Organizational Predictors of Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Several recent reports including the Institute of Medicine's ""Crossing the Quality Chasm"" have called attention to systems or organizational level factors as critical to the improvement of health care quality in the United States. In addition, understanding the context or environment in which an organization exists is also important to crafting policy-relevant research. The predominance of managed care organizations over the last two decades is an example of an environmental influence that has changed the organization and delivery of health care in the United States. The purpose of the proposed research is to examine how the environmental context of an organization influences organizational structures and processes and ultimately affects the care delivered at the site. The clinical focus of this study is colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. To date, most of the research on the delivery of CRC screening has focused on individual patient-level factors, leaving the influence of organizational factors poorly understood. This cross sectional study uses data from several different sources including: Interstudy, the Area Resource File, and the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA). Ordinary least squares and multi-level logistic regression models will be used to explore: (1) the relationship between managed care penetration and adoption of managed care practices in the VHA that may affect CRC screening rates; (2) the relationship between managed care penetration and receipt of colorectal cancer screening within the VHA system; and (3) the effect of managed care penetration on the probability of receiving CRC screening inside the VHA system among those who received CRC screening. Understanding the relationship of organizational influences and variations in the delivery of CRC screening will provide a better understanding of the barriers to the use of this service. Such information may serve as the basis for the design of interventions to improve CRC screening.         n/a",Organizational Predictors of Colon Cancer Screening,6802918,R36HS014518,"['colorectal neoplasms', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'managed care', 'mathematical model', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'statistics /biometry']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R36,2004,29997,0.1895291105461421

"Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Assessing whether items are biased against minority groups is very important for the validity of measurement scales in cancer control and in health sciences in general. Although we have scales to measure beliefs (based on the Health Belief Model) that are predictive of cancer screening behavior, we do not know the extent of cultural bias. Thus, we are missing a critical component in the assessment of psychometric validity. The statistical techniques for detecting item bias are called procedures for detecting differential item functioning (DIF). Under certain conditions, two of the most commonly-used DIF procedures, logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel, can inaccurately display inflated Type I error. The primary purpose of the present methodological proposal is to improve power and Type I error of both the logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel procedures by using alternative matching scores other than traditional summed-item score. Using existing data from two large NIH-funded randomized intervention trials to increase mammography screening (ideal because of equal percentages of Caucasians and African-Americans), we will address these aims: (1) Using computer simulations based on the data structure for generalizing results to breast cancer screening belief scales, we will evaluate the extent to which innovative modifications of logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures control Type I error inflation and improve power, and (2) Using the best modified logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures (derived from Aim 1), assess items for DIF in the two existing data sets based upon ethnicity, age, education and income in six scales commonly used to predict cancer screening (barriers, benefits, susceptibility, fatalism, self-efficacy, and fear). Improved accuracy of DIF procedures will increase the validity of cancer control scales, providing a firm measurement foundation for advancing the science of cancer control and prevention. Additionally, the findings will have broad applicability to detecting item bias in other scales. n/a",Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales,6889155,R03CA113099,"['analytical method', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'belief', 'bias', 'cancer prevention', 'computer simulation', 'health behavior', 'health disparity', 'human data', 'mammography', 'mass screening', 'method development', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R03,2004,73289,0.0071481285051684575

"Prospective study on viral load of cervical cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to bring about prevention of cervix cancer through improved biologic understanding and more cost-effective screening strategies. Although human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer, it is incompletely known if viral load of HPV influences progression from cancer in situ (CIS) to invasive cancer and/or interacts with genetic factors. Since clinical intervention precludes direct observation of this progression. unconventional approaches are needed. Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested design in this large study base with up to 25 years of complete follow-up, we will identify 600 women with invasive cancer, 600 women with CIS and 600 individually matched control women to each case-group. Using validated and sensitive PCR assays, the presence of viral DNA - and for HPV 16, also the viral load -will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on average four per individual, giving a total of about 9600 smears).

It will refine measures of geographic access to           cancer prevention, treatment, and screening services in Iowa by computing            values using fine-scaled geographic data on individuals, the spatial choices of      individuals, and the locations of services providers, It will use Iowa Cancer        Registry (SEER) data for a ten year period (1900-1999) and linked patient files      to Medicare and selected medical insurance records. It will compute statistical      models from the family of logistic regression models to associate specific           cancer burden measures to predictor vanables that capture local characteristics      of the area and characteristics of the individuals. The cancer burden measures       for breast and colorectal cancer are stage at diagnosis, five-year survival,         and probability of screening. The methodology will develop a regional                simulation workbench (RSW) to generate the expected range and variations in the      cancer burden measures for small geographic areas of Iowa based on local             demographic characteristics of the area and statewide cancer burden rates.

"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,6717532,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2004,468563,0.06265914669688735

The purpose of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions, a tailored telephone counseling intervention and a nontailored print intervention, designed to increase participation in CRC with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. The nontailored intervention will be an American Cancer Society health education booklet that contains messages about colorectal cancer, risk factors, screening recommendations, and screening tests. The tailored telephone counseling intervention will be delivered by trained nurses and will contain individually tailored messages for each participant based on baseline assessment of their individual demographics, CRC risk factors, Health Belief Model constructs (perceived risks, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy), and stages of change for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This study contrasts two groups of first-degree relatives (FDRs) who will be randomly assigned to the tailored telephone intervention arm or the nontailored intervention arm. Participants will be 220 FDRs (110 in each arm) who were referred by family members diagnosed with CAP. Data will be collected via structured telephone interviews at baseline, prior to randomization, and at 3 months post-baseline. Behavioral outcomes will be measured dichotomously by whether participants have has a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and by stages of change for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy based on Prochaska and DiClemente's Transtheoretical Model. Both process and outcome evaluations are planned. Primary analyses of screening participation outcomes will use Fischer's exact test to compare proportions of participants who report being screened with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy at follow-up. Logistic regression will be used to examine other potential predictors of screening participation. Stages of change will be tested using ordinal logistic regression with group as the predictor for each screening test.   n/a",Telehealth Intervention for Colorectal Cancer Screening,6573717,R15NR007999,"['adenomatous polyps', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' colorectal neoplasms', ' counseling', ' endoscopy', ' family genetics', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' genetic susceptibility', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' interview', ' nursing intervention', ' questionnaires', ' telemedicine']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R15,2003,150500,0.14618567760303505
"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening. n/a",Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial,6596458,R01CA100856,"['Asian Americans', ' Internet', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' colorectal neoplasms', ' continuing education', ' education evaluation /planning', ' educational resource design /development', ' health disparity', ' health surveys', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' information dissemination', ' longitudinal human study', ' mass screening', ' medical education', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer education', ' patient oriented research', ' radio', ' television', ' videotape /videodisc']",NCI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CANCER CENTER,R01,2003,383026,0.1460534091936561
"Prospective study on viral load of cervical cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to bring about prevention of cervix cancer through improved biologic understanding and more cost-effective screening strategies. Although human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer, it is incompletely known if viral load of HPV influences progression from cancer in situ (CIS) to invasive cancer and/or interacts with genetic factors. Since clinical intervention precludes direct observation of this progression. unconventional approaches are needed. Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested design in this large study base with up to 25 years of complete follow-up, we will identify 600 women with invasive cancer, 600 women with CIS and 600 individually matched control women to each case-group. Using validated and sensitive PCR assays, the presence of viral DNA - and for HPV 16, also the viral load -will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on average four per individual, giving a total of about 9600 smears).

It will refine measures of geographic access to           cancer prevention, treatment, and screening services in Iowa by computing            values using fine-scaled geographic data on individuals, the spatial choices of      individuals, and the locations of services providers, It will use Iowa Cancer        Registry (SEER) data for a ten year period (1900-1999) and linked patient files      to Medicare and selected medical insurance records. It will compute statistical      models from the family of logistic regression models to associate specific           cancer burden measures to predictor vanables that capture local characteristics      of the area and characteristics of the individuals. The cancer burden measures       for breast and colorectal cancer are stage at diagnosis, five-year survival,         and probability of screening. The methodology will develop a regional                simulation workbench (RSW) to generate the expected range and variations in the      cancer burden measures for small geographic areas of Iowa based on local             demographic characteristics of the area and statewide cancer burden rates.

"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors. Specially, we hypothesize that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR interact with dietary such as calcium, vitamin D, sugar, and glycemic index; sunshine exposure, physical activity, aspirin use, and body size to alter risk of colorectal cancer; that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with specific types of mutations in tumors including microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with survival after diagnosis.  To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.

"Interventions to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States with the majority of CRC diagnosed in those aged 50 or older. Prospective data indicate that annual fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) can decease mortality from CRC. The American Cancer Society recommends an annual FOBT and a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. Utilization of these tests is very low, ranging from 19% to 39%, especially among those who are 50 or older and most at risk for developing the disease. Tailored interventions have demonstrated significant increases in mammography use, and may be effective in the area of CRC screening as well. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a tailored versus a non-tailored intervention designed to increase the use of FOBT and sigmoidoscopy, and to determine its effect on cognitive stage of behavior. The theoretical framework for this study was derived from the Health Belief and Transtheoretical Models. Institutional review board approval will be obtained before data collection. All instruments proposed in this study were previously tested for reliability and validity.

"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING DESCRIPTION:  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer      mortality among men and women in the United States.  Though early detection      can lead to decreased mortality and morbidity, screening remains markedly        underutilized by persons at increased risk:  those aged 51 and older and         those with a family history, personal history of colorectal polyps,              ulcerative colitis, high fat/low fiber diets, and sedentary life-styles.         And, previous research findings with respect to breast cancer prevention         have shown that beliefs and health system factors can influence screening        behavior.  This work has not been extended to CRC, and work framed by the        Trans-Theoretical Model's stages of change has also not been conducted in        the area.  The purpose of the proposed study is, therefore, to examine the       relationship of selected predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors on      stages of adoption of CRC screening (including Fecal Occult Blood                Testing/FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy).  Univariate              statistical techniques (correlations, ANOVA, t-test, Chi Square) will be         utilized to examine relationships among predisposing, enabling, and              reinforcing factors, and stage of CRC screening adoption.  Polytomous            logistic regression analysis will be conducted to determine the set of           predictors significantly associated with each stage of screening behavior.
