"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10226398,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,54000,0.08183178544448597
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk. Novel pathways, and specific genes, proteins, and metabolites identified in this research will serve as the critical first steps for future development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D prevention and treatment.",Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach,10003234,K99DK122128,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'IL6 gene', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Nutritional', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Study of Latinos', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic architecture', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high dimensionality', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,89999,0.030037305358377387
"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10263513,U01DK108314,"['Adult', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cancer Detection', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'County', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzymes', 'Exocrine pancreas', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'imaging modality', 'liquid biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organizational structure', 'participant retention', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'recruit', 'response', 'study population', 'treatment trial', 'working group']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,90342,-0.013902905708811105
"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy. To achieve these goals, Dr. Zhou plans to receive more education and training in the following four areas: (1) Critical training in conducting translational research in the hospital environment with surgeons and radiologists, (2) knowledge in the development of technologies for surgical guidance, (3) training in machine learning and its applications in medicine, and (4) training on writing grant applications independently and seeking funding.

"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,0.024492535464999795
"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10105139,K25HD104004,"['Abnormal placentation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cellularity', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Risk Woman', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perinatal', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrapartum', 'maternal morbidity', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,114184,-0.02100659404798106
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",9892855,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2020,124188,-0.030826404771848087
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9963329,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,128408,0.02942735564903371
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,0.012681327718079668
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,0.014780160797509384
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly.

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death.

"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team.

"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9850130,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'structured data']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2020,166320,0.005101994863131697
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing. If successful, this project will reduce the cardiac testing burden and facilitate activation for transplant for patients on the kidney transplant waitlist.",Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates,9871208,K23DK123410,"['Accreditation', 'Age', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Wait Time', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'older patient', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive test', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'screening', 'skills']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,166536,-0.021318373158045065
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),9892829,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2020,168411,0.015755207072944727
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9851429,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'treatment guidelines', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,172001,0.05943877359838449
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9882206,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2020,176541,0.07089738324192732
"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10074162,U01DK108314,"['Adult', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cancer Detection', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'County', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzymes', 'Exocrine pancreas', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'imaging modality', 'liquid biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organizational structure', 'participant retention', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'recruit', 'response', 'study population', 'treatment trial', 'working group']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,176996,-0.013902905708811105
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9977506,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,177444,-0.026816848976381452
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9982695,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,177770,-0.03230477392333993
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9974565,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,186155,0.06103882186538231
"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement.

"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year.

"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9928452,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Small Intestines', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'epithelium regeneration', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'tissue injury', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2020,192552,0.019148106168794678
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10055272,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192780,0.012502786806119904
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10001486,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,192914,0.08183178544448597
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10019612,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,200880,0.021480881282624834
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9951022,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,203040,0.06683241421185293
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9995499,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'automated algorithm', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization', 'unstructured data']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2020,238049,0.04038009662458013
"Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, and damage to the eyes, in particular diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is diagnosed in a third of people with diabetes and which is the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. T2DM is clinically diagnosed by parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests. Due to its long pre- symptomatic phase, an estimate of 25% of diabetics in the US are undiagnosed. In this project, the relationship between spatial patterns of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RNFLT), measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood test levels as well as levels of DR severity is investigated in 9,261 participants of a population based study.  In a first step, OCT RNFLT measurements of the macular and the circumpapillary area around optic nerve head are segmented into spatial sectors, and representative spatial patterns of RNFLT are calculated by an unsupervised machine learning method. Afterwards, a multivariate linear model comparison is performed with the coefficients of the spatial RNFLT patterns as regressors and diagnostic blood test results as dependent variable. The optimal combination of the RNFLT patterns, determined by an established model selection criterion (Bayes Factor), is expected to reveal insight into the association between the specific retinal locations of RNFL thinning accompanying the change in parameters related glucose metabolism during the development and progression of T2DM. Furthermore, fundus images are graded by DR severity following a nine-step scale derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study from no DR to severe proliferative DR. The spatial RNFLT patterns and metabolic blood test scores are then compared with respect to modeling DR severity by linear regression. An optimal model of DR severity combining glucose metabolism parameters and RNFLT patterns is developed. Finally, in an analogous procedure, DR severity of the follow-up measurement, five years after baseline, is statistically predicted from RNFLT and metabolic blood parameters and from their change over time.  To summarize, the proposed research identifies spatial patterns of RNFLT associated with parameters of glucose metabolism and their development over DR severity. Once accomplished, the proposed project would provide the details to establish RNFLT as an alternative manifestation of T2DM that complements diagnostic blood tests and thereby, for instance, lay the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate T2DM progression monitoring or the prediction of the onset of DR. Project Narrative Parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests are clinically used to diagnose diabetes, a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. Decreased levels of blood glucose tolerance have been associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, but these results were based on comparisons between small populations of diagnosed diabetics and healthy controls, and RNFL was typically represented by coarse summary parameters which neglect retinal anatomy. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the relationship between spatial patterns of RNFL thickness, present and future DR severity, and diagnostic blood test results in 9,261 participants of a population based study, with the final goal to establish and quantify RNFL thickness as an alternative manifestation of diabetes that complements diagnostic blood tests and lays the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate disease progression monitoring or the prediction of DR onset.",Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy,10002287,R21EY030631,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Tests', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'age group', 'archetypal analysis', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diabetic', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'follow-up', 'fundus imaging', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose tolerance', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'neglect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'public health relevance', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2020,240285,0.04721934292432154
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10118580,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248966,0.006514863967609398
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Diabetic Retinopathy: genetics and neurodegeneration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of vision loss among working aged adults. Its prevalence is increasing and despite the strides in knowledge and treatments, our understanding of the pathways leading to vision loss in DM remains limited. Hyperglycemia and duration of DM contribute to but do not fully explain the predisposition to develop diabetic retinal diseases. Given the predisposition for diabetic retinal diseases to cluster in families, genetic risk factors are thought to be important but none has so far been definitively implicated. Furthermore, data from small studies suggest that there are more phenotypes of diabetic retinal disease than are currently recognized in clinical practice. Diabetic retinal disease has traditionally been considered primarily a vascular process: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the main clinical manifestations. With improved imaging modalities and image analysis algorithms, there has been increasing recognition of a new clinical manifestation of diabetic retinal disease, diabetic retinal neurodegeneration (DRN). This is visible as alterations in thickness of retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and/or ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To date, DRN is poorly understood, and its role in clinical management of patients with DM has not been established. However, if retinal neurodegeneration occurs and is progressive, it can lead to profound visual difficulties for patients with DM. DRN may account for previously unexplained poor visual outcomes among patients with diabetic retinal disease despite standard of care treatment. Dr. Channa is a retina specialist, with prior research experience in retinal imaging and clinical trials of novel treatments for DME. In this K23 career development award she proposes to use a nationally representative dataset, the UK Biobank cohort to: 1) improve our understanding of DRN by determining RNFL and GCL thickness, using OCT imaging, in participants with DM (who have no DR or DME) compared to those who do not have DM 2) determine genetic factors associated with DR, DME and DRN. Dr. Channa proposes a career development plan, which includes mentorship, coursework, publications and clinical time. This will situate her as an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing bioinformatics and computational skills in genomics and retinal image analysis to elucidate pathways of vision loss among patients with DM, ultimately leading to development of novel therapies. Her research work and career development will take place in the academic and collaborative environment of the largest medical center in the world, where she has institutional support and mentorship to develop as an independent clinician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this career development award we aim to use genetic and retinal imaging data to enhance our understanding of the pathways that can lead to vision loss among people with diabetic retinal diseases.

"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this project, we present EyeMark, a system with advanced longitudinal image anal- ysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we have developed tools for computation of microan- eurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high pos- itive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progres- sion, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a prototype tool that robustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects and localizes DR le- sions. This fully automated tool can work on the cloud to produces results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. This commercialization readiness pilot (CRP) project is intended to develop a regulatory strategy and a market access plan for EyeMark to enable its introduction in the US market and foster commercial success. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,10082344,SB1TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Price', 'Process', 'Prothrombin', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal analysis', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'sound', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",SB1,2020,300000,0.0500855740007644
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9923450,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334508,0.028029857017347757
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9998934,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,344849,0.014942860653223084
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment. In addition, objective OCTA analysis based automated DR classification can foster telemedicine in rural and underserved areas where the access to experienced ophthalmologists is limited.",Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy,9857745,R01EY030842,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Caliber', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye diseases', 'Fostering', 'Fundus photography', 'Geometry', 'Health Expenditures', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Retina', 'Retinal Edemas', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Width', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'clinical biomarkers', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'global health', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'macular edema', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rural underserved', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'vascular abnormality']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,362544,0.047520669652882964

All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9673231,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,90185,0.006514863967609398
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies.

"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9722280,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2019,129089,0.02942735564903371
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,0.014780160797509384
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly.

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death.

"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team.

"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9928552,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistics']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,166320,0.005101994863131697
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9645316,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172692,0.05943877359838449
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,176541,0.07089738324192732
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9806592,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,176990,-0.03230477392333993
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms.

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9819865,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Fall injury', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2019,186183,0.035242862219210296
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,0.08183178544448597
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9733206,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,194368,0.07835340575499991
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,9871037,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disorder subtype', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,200880,0.021480881282624834
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9721752,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,203040,0.06683241421185293

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9747894,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2019,215352,0.08790169694513862
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9756410,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,233078,0.04038009662458013
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9646340,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2019,249000,0.034479284453258
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9769695,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,256000,0.014942860653223084
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year.

"Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, and damage to the eyes, in particular diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is diagnosed in a third of people with diabetes and which is the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. T2DM is clinically diagnosed by parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests. Due to its long pre- symptomatic phase, an estimate of 25% of diabetics in the US are undiagnosed. In this project, the relationship between spatial patterns of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RNFLT), measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood test levels as well as levels of DR severity is investigated in 9,261 participants of a population based study.  In a first step, OCT RNFLT measurements of the macular and the circumpapillary area around optic nerve head are segmented into spatial sectors, and representative spatial patterns of RNFLT are calculated by an unsupervised machine learning method. Afterwards, a multivariate linear model comparison is performed with the coefficients of the spatial RNFLT patterns as regressors and diagnostic blood test results as dependent variable. The optimal combination of the RNFLT patterns, determined by an established model selection criterion (Bayes Factor), is expected to reveal insight into the association between the specific retinal locations of RNFL thinning accompanying the change in parameters related glucose metabolism during the development and progression of T2DM. Furthermore, fundus images are graded by DR severity following a nine-step scale derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study from no DR to severe proliferative DR. The spatial RNFLT patterns and metabolic blood test scores are then compared with respect to modeling DR severity by linear regression. An optimal model of DR severity combining glucose metabolism parameters and RNFLT patterns is developed. Finally, in an analogous procedure, DR severity of the follow-up measurement, five years after baseline, is statistically predicted from RNFLT and metabolic blood parameters and from their change over time.  To summarize, the proposed research identifies spatial patterns of RNFLT associated with parameters of glucose metabolism and their development over DR severity. Once accomplished, the proposed project would provide the details to establish RNFLT as an alternative manifestation of T2DM that complements diagnostic blood tests and thereby, for instance, lay the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate T2DM progression monitoring or the prediction of the onset of DR. Project Narrative Parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests are clinically used to diagnose diabetes, a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. Decreased levels of blood glucose tolerance have been associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, but these results were based on comparisons between small populations of diagnosed diabetics and healthy controls, and RNFL was typically represented by coarse summary parameters which neglect retinal anatomy. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the relationship between spatial patterns of RNFL thickness, present and future DR severity, and diagnostic blood test results in 9,261 participants of a population based study, with the final goal to establish and quantify RNFL thickness as an alternative manifestation of diabetes that complements diagnostic blood tests and lays the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate disease progression monitoring or the prediction of DR onset.",Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy,9809589,R21EY030631,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Tests', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diabetic', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'follow-up', 'fundus imaging', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose tolerance', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macula', 'neglect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'public health relevance', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2019,313837,0.04721934292432154
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9695208,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,335803,0.028029857017347757
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeMark, a set of advanced image analysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) ap- pearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a bi- omarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influ- ence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a MA turnover computation prototype tool that ro- bustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects DR lesions (lesion level AUROC>=0.95). The tool provides graceful degradation to confounding image factors by reporting MA turnover as a range, thereby capturing the inherent confidence in MA detection. By the end of Phase IIB we will develop a market ready, clinically validated end-to-end desktop software for robust, automated longitudinal lesion analysis and characterization that can work on the cloud to produce results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,9735477,R44TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'macula', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'serial imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2019,750000,0.04361460177581058
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state. Building on New Jersey’s already significant capabilities to promote and facilitate clinical and translational research, NJ ACTS will serve as a catalyst, inspiring new approaches to diagnose and manage disease, and fostering career development of the next generation of translational researchers, and promoting population health.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS,9831333,UL1TR003017,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asian Indian', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Cuban', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease Management', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'Muslim population group', 'New Jersey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Ontology', 'Oral health', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Science', 'Solid', 'South Asian', 'Special Populations Research', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Workforce Development', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohesion', 'community based participatory research', 'disease heterogeneity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'logarithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'trial design']",NCATS,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,UL1,2019,4776211,0.014601147297599964
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9504168,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2018,90050,0.006514863967609398
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene.

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9526588,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2018,141114,0.014780160797509384
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9566167,K01DK110136,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2018,154915,0.03035759440163541
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9521378,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adult obesity', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2018,155914,0.05129159240919485
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030.

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9393346,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical implementation', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2018,163944,0.04858965678856331
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9544317,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2018,164330,0.014753196918361638
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9530687,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2018,186155,0.06103882186538231
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,0.08183178544448597
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9513528,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,194368,0.07835340575499991
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat.

"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9574973,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2018,237398,0.04038009662458013
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9441722,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2018,249000,0.034479284453258
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9608453,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,295209,0.014942860653223084
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9418599,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,336980,0.028029857017347757
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeMark, a set of advanced image analysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) ap- pearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a bi- omarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influ- ence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a MA turnover computation prototype tool that ro- bustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects DR lesions (lesion level AUROC>=0.95). The tool provides graceful degradation to confounding image factors by reporting MA turnover as a range, thereby capturing the inherent confidence in MA detection. By the end of Phase IIB we will develop a market ready, clinically validated end-to-end desktop software for robust, automated longitudinal lesion analysis and characterization that can work on the cloud to produce results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,9622980,R44TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'macula', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2018,750000,0.04361460177581058
"RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening Project Summary Over the past two decades, diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become the leading cause of adult blindness in the US, affecting 40% of all diabetic patients and resulting in $500 million a year in direct medical costs. Vision loss due to DR is largely preventable and can be reduced by up to 90% with appropriate eye screening. However, in the US, less than 50% of diabetic patients receive a recommended yearly eye exam due to many factors that include lack of access to eye care professionals. Distributed tele-ophthalmic screening thru primary care clinics can potentially provide all diabetic patients cost- effective, yearly evaluations to detect DR and prevent vision loss. However, gold-standard sensitive detection of DR using standard retinal photography is complex and cumbersome process requiring up to 7 images per eye. This screening process cannot for all practical purposes be achieved without having highly trained ophthalmic photographers. RetiVue proposes to develop the RetiVue DR in collaboration with Olympus, to create the first handheld, non- mydriatic, 160 field of view, widefield DR screening camera. It will allow single photo capture of an area up to ten times greater than conventional fundus cameras, allowing sensitive detection of DR at its earliest time points. Full integration of RetiVue and Olympus hardware will enable the most advanced and highest image quality handheld retina camera on the market. Use of automated alignment, auto laser focus, and auto image capture will allow complex imaging of the retina to be performed simply by positioning the iris, requiring no user knowledge of retinal anatomy. We have established clinical proof of concept with our patented technology, but require several additional innovations in optical design, automated image recognition, and retinal image processing to enable a commercial device. We will for this proposal optimize our alignment system and laser based focusing system for widefield imaging, allowing automated alignment and focus to image the retina before eye movement occurs. We will develop a new method of widefield, non-mydriatic peripheral retinal imaging using multiple LED slit-beam projectors to allow rapid, segmental, sequential image capture of 90°, 120°, and 160° FOV on diabetic patients. Finally, we will create the most advanced retinal image processing algorithms to remove Purkinje haze which prevents conventional cameras from imaging beyond 45° FOV and enable seamless stitching of segmental peripheral retina images into a single widefield image. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a blinding eye disease that affects millions of people with diabetes and costs the US $500 million a year in medical costs. Loss of vision can be prevented if diabetic patients undergo yearly eye screening that examines the retina to detect this disease, but currently less than 50% of diabetics do so. At Re- tiVue LLC, we are designing the first easy to use handheld eye camera to allow primary care doctors to take DSLR quality pictures of the eye to look for diabetic retinopathy. Our eye camera will see 5 times more of the retina than any other handheld camera, ensuring that we find diabetic retinopathy when it first occurs. Earlier detection of diabetic retinopathy will give diabetic patients the best chance to keep their vision long term, and avoid unnecessary blindness.","RetiVue DR, a point and shoot, non-mydriatic, widefield retinal camera for diabetic eye screening",9564677,R44EY028484,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Masks', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Photography', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNFRSF10B gene', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Validation', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'lens', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'retinal imaging', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'seal', 'sensor', 'success']",NEI,RETIVUE,R44,2018,847697,0.026807340666792388
"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis,9385849,K99AR070902,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2017,94041,0.00806045010609149
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9312144,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2017,130380,0.02942735564903371
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9528113,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2017,155914,0.05129159240919485
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career.

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9198041,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2017,163944,0.04858965678856331
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,9293966,K08AI100997,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood group antigen S', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Epidemiology', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine discovery', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2017,165996,0.06789504167126509
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9335456,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2017,166910,0.014753196918361638
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9306838,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,194400,0.07835340575499991
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2017,225549,0.08790169694513862
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9394884,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2017,249000,0.034479284453258
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9306637,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,340545,0.028029857017347757
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase IIB application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by conducting formal clinical trials and integrating it into several clinical information systems. With its fully automated use, high throughput capability (can analyze several thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers. DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, it is the one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US and 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and more accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening sensitivity (safety) and efficacy on multiple large real-world datasets including one with over 54,000 patient cases (and 434,000 images) obtained from EyePACS, a DR telescreening system with over 360 sites in the US and elsewhere. Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. Going forward, we will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials and integrate it into clinical informatio systems to enable EyeArt's seamless incorporation into existing clinical workflows. This will pave the way for EyeArt's availability to the US DR screening market and reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity. This will help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus help in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening system will help in screening patients in need of expert care thus making DR screening more efficient, cost- effective, and accessible. EyeArt's integration into EyePACS, a DR telescreening system, will facilitate an expansion of DR screening within the large and expanding EyePACs network of primary care centers in the US and elsewhere. We are also collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) which already uses the EyePACS to deploy our system following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup which caters to large disparity populations of LA County.

"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9239538,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,36936,0.05129159240919485

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9147601,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2016,49355,0.08790169694513862
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9125796,K99CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning network', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2016,109620,0.034479284453258
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Mobility', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,0.0512614692229974
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,9108235,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'training opportunity', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2016,137160,0.05621563068860932
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9096792,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,155914,0.05129159240919485
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,9096006,K08AI100997,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2016,155984,0.06789504167126509
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8984911,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2016,163944,0.04858965678856331
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians. By incorporating artificial intelligence and social networking into a FHx tool, it will lead to greater engagement with FHx collection.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9119811,K23DK101687,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2016,180360,0.07835340575499991
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase IIB application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by conducting formal clinical trials and integrating it into several clinical information systems. With its fully automated use, high throughput capability (can analyze several thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers. DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, it is the one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US and 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and more accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening sensitivity (safety) and efficacy on multiple large real-world datasets including one with over 54,000 patient cases (and 434,000 images) obtained from EyePACS, a DR telescreening system with over 360 sites in the US and elsewhere. Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. Going forward, we will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials and integrate it into clinical informatio systems to enable EyeArt's seamless incorporation into existing clinical workflows. This will pave the way for EyeArt's availability to the US DR screening market and reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity. This will help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus help in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening system will help in screening patients in need of expert care thus making DR screening more efficient, cost- effective, and accessible. EyeArt's integration into EyePACS, a DR telescreening system, will facilitate an expansion of DR screening within the large and expanding EyePACs network of primary care centers in the US and elsewhere. We are also collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) which already uses the EyePACS to deploy our system following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup which caters to large disparity populations of LA County. The increased access to DR screening will help reduce and ultimately eliminate vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application,9142236,R44EY026864,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Europe', 'European', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Italy', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost effective', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'improved', 'macular edema', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2016,984026,0.06652729823063251
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8897359,K23DK090304,"['Academy', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,37402,0.06152752774072282
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,8805692,K99CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2015,109620,0.034479284453258
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,8849803,K01AG043503,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Country', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychology', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'social', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2015,128358,0.07241175281508366
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8788442,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2015,129546,0.04858965678856331
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,0.0512614692229974
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8875578,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,0.05621563068860932
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8935814,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2015,155674,0.05129159240919485
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,8874869,K08AI100997,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2015,155744,0.06789504167126509
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.            ",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9032882,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2015,166893,0.014753196918361638
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.        ",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,8968013,K23DK101687,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'lecturer', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2015,181860,0.07835340575499991
"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control. LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of insurance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritizatin of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image processing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic diabetic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt - an automated retinal image analysis tool will help in triaging patients in need of expert care and thus reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, while leading to an expansion of screening in primary care centers through its easily accessible telemedicine interface. This increased access to DR care will help prevent vision loss due to diabetes complications in vulnerable disparity populations such as Latinos who do not get screened due to socio-economic factors. To make an immediate impact we are collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) to deploy our system, following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup whic caters to large disparity populations of LA County.",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8891422,R44EB013585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Color', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2015,394177,0.03431395319670176
"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control. LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.            ",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8617518,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2014,129546,0.04858965678856331
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,0.0512614692229974
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8699494,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,0.05621563068860932
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.         PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.

"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research     DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.            ",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8828979,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2014,155674,0.05129159240919485
"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control. LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8730137,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,172287,0.06152752774072282
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR project, we present EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of- care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device comprising of a smartphone-attachable retinal imaging camera and validated software application enabling fully-automated screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is the leading cause of new-onset blindness in working-age adults in the industrialized world today. Studies show that in 90% of the cases vision loss can be prevented if DR is diagnosed at an early stage.  Recommended annual screening is expected to significantly improve outcome for diabetic patients, but even in the developed world, majority of the diabetics do not regularly have the annual screening due to several limiting factors. To make things worse, the current cost of screening all diabetics to detect those with early DR is very high because: (a) most patients will have normal exams (thus, causing inefficient use of specialist's time), (b) retinal imaging equipment is very expensive, and (c) trained technicians must operate the imaging equipment. In this project we address these critical limitations by employing cellphone retinal camera attachment, the Ocular CellScope, developed by our collaborators at UCB/UCSF, which simply attaches to an iPhone, doesn't need a trained technician to operate, will obtain wide-field images, and will cost several orders of mag- nitude less than the current tabletop retinal imaging cameras. Diabetic patients can attach the camera to their smartphones and with some assistance (untrained friend, spouse, or nurse) obtain retinal video for each eye using an app residing on the same phone. This app guides the image capture to ensure that best quality frames are obtained, and also ensure all areas of the eye are imaged enabling wide-field imaging. EyeApp's validated algorithms output a near-instant DR screening recommendation score. EyeApp is con- ceptualized as a culmination of over three years of research and development at Eyenuk (on computerized DR screening) and at UCB/UCSF (on smartphone retinal camera) that has already produced functional prototypes of critical technology modules. This phase I project focusses on seamless integration of these proven modules (the camera hardware and the diagnostic software) via several novel ideas.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of-care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device, will truly enable diabetic retinopathy screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent - since the world diabetic population is estimated to be a staggering 371 million, and is projected to grow to over half a billion by 2030. EyeApp will operate in and end-to-end fashion, from retinal imaging to diagnostic screening, all without needing a trained operator. It will cost orders of magnitude less than conventional retinal cameras, and will simply attach to a smartphone, thus greatly reducing the cost and expanding the availability of screening to vast underserved population in the US and the world.            ",Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera,8782362,R43EY024848,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Chairperson', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'glucose monitor', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'member', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'screening', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2014,217002,0.026657801494348477
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications  Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of in- surance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image pro- cessing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic dia- betic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt - an automated retinal image analysis tool will help in triaging patients in need of expert care and thus reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, while leading to an expansion of screening in primary care centers through its easily accessible telemedicine interface. This increased access to DR care will help prevent vision loss due to diabetes complications in vulnerable disparity populations such as Latinos who do not get screened due to socio-economic factors. To make an immediate impact we are collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) to deploy our system, following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup whic caters to large disparity populations of LA County.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8740363,R44EB013585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Color', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2014,394542,0.03334855935178957
"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8528464,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,0.05621563068860932
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.          PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8521270,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,172287,0.06152752774072282
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics. This award will help the candidate to establish an independent research career, position herself on the front of these new advances, and bring the lessons learned to the field of child psychiatry.

"Mitigating risk in a closed loop system by exercise detection and miniaturization No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US, approximately 1 million people have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputation. Improving blood glucose control with a miniaturized closed loop (automated) system for use within real world situations including those in which patients move about freely and exercise, as proposed here, will decrease the risk of hypoglycemia and the risk of complications that can be debilitating, such as eye disease, and life-threatening, such as heart attacks.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8279285,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2012,105194,0.052038335003419034
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.              Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems.

His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials.

These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8077374,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2011,105194,0.052038335003419034
"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.              Project Narrative Collaboration between malaria Branch of CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine to conduct research to improve the control of malaria in high risk populations, with a special emphasis on studies of the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia and Kenya.",Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01),8131740,U01CK000146,[' '],NCEZID,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2011,109500,0.04942084611020086
"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.

The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics. This award will help the candidate to establish an independent research career, position herself on the front of these new advances, and bring the lessons learned to the field of child psychiatry.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric traits.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.              Project Narrative Collaboration between malaria Branch of CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine to conduct research to improve the control of malaria in high risk populations, with a special emphasis on studies of the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia and Kenya.",Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01),8029719,U01CK000146,[' '],NCEZID,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2010,150000,0.04942084611020086
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population. n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7804478,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rain', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'meetings', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2010,173340,0.059645870256383335
"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Machine Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of Bacterial Pathogens  using Laser Light Scattering  PIs: Dr. M.

The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,7656889,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2009,96901,0.052038335003419034
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population. n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7893468,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rain', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'meetings', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2009,154077,0.059645870256383335
"Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is focused both on career development and on the completion of a specific independent research plan related particularly to the mission of the National Cancer Institute. The career development objective of this award is to enable the transition of Dr. Nathan Price from his current position as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Systems Biology to an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign capable of competing for independent funding in cancer research. Dr. Price has an exceptionally strong track record in systems biology for his career stage, having co-authored over 20 articles for publication in his graduate studies as well as completing significant cancer-related studies during his postdoctoral training. Dr. Price accepted a faculty position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign prior to finishing graduate school, but chose to defer this position for 2-3 years for the express purpose of transitioning his career focus onto systems analysis of cancer. The mentored phase of this award will provide Dr. Price with the opportunity to receive guidance from one of the leading scientists in the world working on systems approaches to cancer, Dr. Leroy Hood, who is President of the Institute for Systems Biology, Director of the Center for Systems Biology, and Co-Director of the Nanosystems Biology Cancer Center. Dr. Price's proposed research focuses on developing a novel capability to identify causal network perturbations involved in glioblastoma through analysis of patterns in secreted protein concentrations. This work will also focus on studying the relationship between transcriptomic data (which is plentiful) with secreted protein data (which serve as ideal diagnostic markers). The associated measurements of secreted proteins will provide a wealth of candidate markers for glioblastomas, and a team of glioblastoma researchers has been assembled to assist in translating the work of this project to the clinic (to be financed elsewhere). The ultimate long-term goal of this work is to develop highly informative secreted protein marker panels for glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive and deadly form of glioma. The use of systems analysis of blood, coupled with computational models of interacting networks such as will be developed in this-study, has the long-term potential not only of identifying perturbed networks in vivo, but eventually of enabling a new avenue of studying human biology and disease in vivo in a non-invasive manner.      The relevance of this work to public health is that specific secreted protein markers for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer common particularly in children, will be developed where none exist today. These rnarkers will allow for the earlier diagnosis and hence better prognosis of patients, and will be far less irjvasive than the brain biopsy currently required to diagnose advanced gliomas. Also, we will identify perturbed subnetworks in the most aggressive type of glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) leading to potential drug targets for further analysis.                    n/a",Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma,7917085,R00CA126184,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Arts', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Australia', 'Award', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Buffers', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caseins', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Core Facility', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dissociation', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Film', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glean', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Halobacterium', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Humidity', 'IGFBP2 gene', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunization', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incubated', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organ Specificity', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Personal Communication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Fingerprints', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Refractive Indices', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Serum-Free Culture Media', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'analog', 'base', 'biological systems', 'candidate marker', 'cell growth', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'clinical application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'cytokine', 'dalton', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaust', 'follow-up', 'glioma cell line', 'halobacteria', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'knowledge base', 'light intensity', 'macrophage', 'mass spectrometer', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'nanosystems', 'network models', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oligodendroglioma', 'polyclonal antibody', 'preference', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R00,2009,249000,0.011786923191274848

"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a Pentored Patient-Oriented Research (K23) Award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency training and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross-sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs and correlations between tri-nucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population.     n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7274143,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Clinical Oncology Award', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Award', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Range', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'programs', 'size', 'skills']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2007,173340,0.060334333040867015

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events. Successful completion of the training and research program will allow Dr. Ayappa to contribute independently to research in the field of sleep physiology. n/a",Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing,6721163,K25HL004420,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'breath tests', 'cardiopulmonary disease', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'disease /disorder classification', 'electrocardiography', 'electroencephalography', 'electromyography', 'electrooculography', 'human subject', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient oriented research', 'polysomnography', 'respiratory airflow disorder', 'respiratory airflow measurement', 'respiratory disorder diagnosis', 'sleep disorders']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K25,2004,147690,0.040251492494718766
"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DESCRIPTION: (Candidate's Abstract) The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: to train Dr. Nichols in the areas of visual epidemiology and biostatistics, to evaluate the systemic and environmental factors associated with dry eye in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and to investigate the relations among dry eye diagnostic tests in this cohort. We plan to utilize the Observational Study (OS) cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at The Ohio State University. Approval for this WHI ancillary study has been obtained from the WHI Executive Committee and the WHI Design and Analysis Committee. In an effort to increase statistical power, a dry eye screening survey will be used to enrich the dry eye cases in this cross-section study design (sometimes called a prevalent case-control study). Following the dry eye screening survey, a dry eye examination will be performed on approximately 750 WHI Observational study participants (350 symptomatic patients, and 400 asymptomatic patients frequency matched by age). The definition of dry eye we will use includes the presence of symptoms of ocular irritation and one of three abnormal dry eye diagnostic tests: tear break-up time, fluorescein staining of the cornea, and measurement of tear meniscus height. Logistic regression will be used to assess the factors associated with a dry eye diagnosis using baseline and year3 follow-up data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Sensitivity and specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will be performed to evaluate the relations between the additional diagnostic tests performed in the dry eye examination (osmolality, lactoferrin concentration, phenol red thread test, and lissamine green conjunctival staining) and our proposed definition of dry eye. The training plan and the research plan are closely related in this proposal. The research plan will produce a data set of adequate scope and size to allow Dr. Nichols to apply the epidemiologic and biostatistical theory learned in the classroom. Throughout the course of the training plan, Dr. Nichols will complete the Ph.D. program in Vision Science/Physiological Optics and the Master's in Public Health program with an emphasis in epidemiology and biostatistics at The Ohio State University. Together, the research plan and the training plan will provide Dr. Nichols with the skills and experience needed to excel as a patient-based clinician-scientist.  n/a",FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY EYE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,6628632,K23EY000393,"['clinical research', ' environmental stressor', ' epidemiology', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' female', ' fluorescent dye /probe', ' human subject', ' interview', ' keratoconjunctivitis sicca', ' longitudinal human study', ' physiologic stressor', ' postmenopause', ' questionnaires', ' statistics /biometry', "" women's health""]",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2003,125465,0.008450606755510131
